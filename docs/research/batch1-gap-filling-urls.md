## Summary

| Source    | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 | 2023 | 2024 | 2025 | Total Found |
|-----------|------|------|------|------|------|------|-------------|
| Fox Sports| 404  | DIV* | DIV* | URL  | URL  | ✓    | 2/5         |
| NFL.com   | URL  | URL  | URL  | URL  | ✓    | URL  | 6/6         |
| SDUT      | URL  | URL  | URL  | URL  | URL  | ✓    | 6/6         |
| SBNation  | 404  | 404  | 404  | 404  | 404  | ✓    | 0/5         |

**Legend:**
- ✓ = Already in grade_sources.json
- URL = Found accessible URL
- 404 = Not found
- DIV* = Division-based articles only (would require scraping multiple URLs)

**Total URLs found for gap-filling:** 14 URLs

**Key Findings:**

1. **NFL.com** - Excellent coverage! Found URLs for ALL missing years (2020-2023, 2025). Chad Reuter's "Quick Snap" or "Snap" grades articles provide consistent comprehensive coverage.

2. **San Diego Union-Tribune** - Perfect coverage! Found URLs for ALL missing years (2020-2024). Consistent annual articles grading all 32 teams.

3. **Fox Sports** - Mixed results. Found comprehensive articles for 2023 and 2024. However, 2021 and 2022 were published as division-based articles rather than single comprehensive pieces. 2020 not found.

4. **SBNation** - Poor historical coverage. No comprehensive "all 32 teams" articles found for 2020-2024. They may have shifted their strategy to focus on team-specific coverage through their blog network rather than league-wide analysis pieces. Only 2025 has a comprehensive article.

**Recommendation:**

- **High Priority:** Add NFL.com and SDUT URLs (20 total new URLs with perfect coverage 2020-2025)
- **Medium Priority:** Add Fox Sports 2023 and 2024 URLs (2 URLs)
- **Low Priority:** Consider Fox Sports 2021 and 2022 division articles if we want that coverage (would require scraping 16 URLs total)
- **Skip:** SBNation historical articles (not available in comprehensive format)

This gives us **22 high-value URLs** to add to grade_sources.json for Batch 1 gap filling.
