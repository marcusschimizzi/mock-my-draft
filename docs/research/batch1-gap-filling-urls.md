## New Sources

### The Athletic

**Research Status:** Not accessible

All years (2020-2025): Could not find accessible articles through web search. The Athletic is a premium subscription service with a hard paywall. Articles do not appear in public search results without subscription access.

**Recommendation:** Skip - Hard paywall prevents access to content.

### USA Today

**Research Status:** Not found

All years (2020-2025): Despite multiple search attempts using various query patterns, no comprehensive "all 32 teams" draft grades articles were found from USA Today. USA Today (Nate Davis) publishes mock drafts but does not appear to publish comprehensive post-draft grades for all 32 teams in a single article format.

**Recommendation:** Skip - No comprehensive "all 32 teams" articles available.

### NFL Network Analysts (Bucky Brooks / Daniel Jeremiah)

**Research Status:** Duplicate of existing NFL.com source

Bucky Brooks and Daniel Jeremiah are NFL Network analysts who publish their draft analysis on NFL.com. Their "quick-snap grades" articles appear to be the same Chad Reuter articles already identified in the NFL.com gap-filling section above. These are not separate articles but rather the same NFL.com coverage already captured.

**Recommendation:** Skip - Already captured in NFL.com URLs.

**Legend:**

- 404 = Not found
- PW = Paywalled (hard paywall, not accessible)
- DIV* = Division-based articles only (would require scraping multiple URLs)

**Total URLs found for gap-filling (Task 1):** 14 URLs
**Total URLs found for new sources (Task 2):** 6 URLs
**Total Batch 1 URLs:** 20 URLs

**Key Findings:**

### Gap Filling Sources (Task 1):

1. **NFL.com** - Excellent coverage! Found URLs for ALL missing years (2020-2023, 2025). Chad Reuter's "Quick Snap" or "Snap" grades articles provide consistent comprehensive coverage.

2. **San Diego Union-Tribune** - Perfect coverage! Found URLs for ALL missing years (2020-2024). Consistent annual articles grading all 32 teams.

3. **Fox Sports** - Mixed results. Found comprehensive articles for 2023 and 2024. However, 2021 and 2022 were published as division-based articles rather than single comprehensive pieces. 2020 not found.

4. **SBNation** - Poor historical coverage. No comprehensive "all 32 teams" articles found for 2020-2024. They may have shifted their strategy to focus on team-specific coverage through their blog network rather than league-wide analysis pieces. Only 2025 has a comprehensive article.

### New Sources (Task 2):

5. **Sports Illustrated** - Excellent coverage! Found comprehensive "all 32 teams" articles for ALL years (2020-2025). Consistent annual coverage with detailed analysis and letter grades.

6. **The Athletic** - Not accessible. Hard paywall prevents access to content. Articles do not appear in public search results.

7. **USA Today** - Not found. No comprehensive "all 32 teams" draft grades articles were found despite multiple search attempts. USA Today focuses on mock drafts rather than post-draft grades.

8. **NFL Network Analysts** - Duplicate of NFL.com. Bucky Brooks and Daniel Jeremiah's grades are published as part of the NFL.com Quick Snap grades already captured above.

**Recommendation:**

- **High Priority:** Add NFL.com and SDUT gap-filling URLs (14 URLs)
- **High Priority:** Add Sports Illustrated URLs for all years (6 URLs)
- **Medium Priority:** Add Fox Sports 2023 and 2024 URLs (2 URLs)
- **Low Priority:** Consider Fox Sports 2021 and 2022 division articles if we want that coverage (would require scraping 16 URLs total)
- **Skip:** SBNation historical articles (not available in comprehensive format)
- **Skip:** The Athletic (hard paywall)
- **Skip:** USA Today (no comprehensive articles available)

This gives us **20 high-value URLs** to add to grade_sources.json for Batch 1 (14 gap-filling + 6 new source).
