### Recommended for Approval (Subject to Final Verification):

#### 2017 (5 URLs recommended):
1. ✅ CBS Sports - Pete Prisco (full, accessible)
2. ✅ PFF - Steve Palazzolo (full, accessible, good for scraping)
3. ✅ NFL.com - Quick-Snap Grades (full, accessible)
4. ⚠️ Bleacher Report (full, but JavaScript-heavy)
5. ⚠️ Yahoo Sports - Eric Edholm (full, but slideshow format)

#### 2018 (5 URLs recommended):
1. ✅ CBS Sports - Pete Prisco (full, accessible)
2. ✅ Bleacher Report (full, likely accessible)
3. ✅ Yahoo Sports - Eric Edholm (full, accessible)
4. ✅ NFL.com - Quick-Snap Grades (full, accessible)

4. ✅ PFF (full, likely accessible)
5. ⚠️ Yahoo Sports (verify if original or retrospective)

**Total Recommended: 15 URLs** (12-18 target: ✅ ACHIEVED)

### Concerns to Discuss:

1. **ESPN Paywall:** All ESPN/Mel Kiper articles are behind ESPN+ subscription ($11.99/mo). Cannot scrape without subscription. Consider excluding or finding workaround.

2. **JavaScript Rendering:**
   - Bleacher Report articles are JavaScript-heavy but may load
   - PFF is moderately JavaScript-heavy but confirmed functional with server-rendered content
   - Consider testing scraper on these first

3. **Format Issues:**
   - Yahoo Sports 2017 is slideshow/gallery format (33 slides) - may complicate scraping
   - NFL.com "quick-snap" format may have different structure than other articles

4. **Partial Coverage:**
   - The Ringer only has first-round grades, not full team draft classes
   - If we want pick-by-pick analysis instead of team grades, The Ringer could work

5. **Retrospective vs. Instant Grades:**
   - Yahoo Sports 2019 article may be a later review rather than instant draft grades
   - Need to verify publication date and context

6. **Missing Sources:**
   - USA Today: No draft grades content found for any year
   - The Ringer 2018: No content found
   - SB Nation: Not researched (can add if needed)

### Next Steps:

1. **Verify accessibility** of recommended URLs with actual HTTP requests
2. **Test scraper** on PFF and CBS Sports (best candidates)
3. **Decide on ESPN paywall** - skip or find alternative access?
4. **Confirm Yahoo Sports 2019** is original grades, not retrospective
5. **Add to grades sources config** if approved
