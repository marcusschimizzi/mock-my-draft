## 7. Recommendations

### Immediate Next Steps

1. **Seed Database**
   - Import all 1,306 grade entries into PostgreSQL
   - Verify foreign key relationships (teams, sources)
   - Test API endpoints with seeded data

2. **Address Grade Normalization**
   - Update `gradeToNumeric` function to handle en dash character (–)
   - Decide on "A++" grade handling (treat as A+ or create new grade level)
   - Re-run 2022 extraction to capture 10 missing grades

3. **ESPN Workaround**
   - Consider manual entry for ESPN grades (192 missing entries)
   - Explore alternative ESPN sources (ESPN Radio, ESPN podcasts, etc.)
   - Document paywall as known limitation

### Future Improvements

4. **PFF Rendering**
   - Investigate headless browser configuration for PFF
   - Consider longer page load waits or scroll-triggered rendering
   - Test with different browser engines (Chromium vs Firefox)

5. **Format Detection**
   - Add pre-flight check to detect article format
   - Create format-specific extraction templates
   - Handle "Best/Worst Pick" articles separately

6. **Validation Automation**
   - Create automated validation script
   - Generate this report programmatically after each collection
   - Set up alerts for low completion rates

### Data Quality Enhancements

7. **Player Grade Extraction**
   - Verify player grade data quality
   - Cross-reference player names with draft records
   - Validate player-to-team assignments

8. **Source Metadata**
   - Add publication date to each entry
   - Track author information
   - Store article headlines

9. **Duplicate Detection**
   - Check for duplicate entries across sources
   - Identify syndicated content
   - Flag identical text analysis across sources

### Long-term Strategy

10. **Historical Expansion (Batch 2)**
    - Target years 2015-2019 (5 additional years)
    - Research source availability for older years
    - Expect lower completion rates for historical data

11. **Real-time Collection**
    - Set up automated collection for 2026 draft (May 2026)
    - Monitor source URLs for new publications
    - Create notification system for new articles

12. **Community Contribution**
    - Allow users to submit missing sources
    - Implement crowd-sourced grade verification
    - Create public API for grade data access
