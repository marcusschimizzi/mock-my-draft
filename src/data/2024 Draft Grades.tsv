class	fox-sports	arz	a	Cardinals GM Monti Ossenfort lived up to his reputation as a wheeler and dealer. Since taking over in 2023, Ossenfort has brokered 11 trades, including six on draft day and a pair on draft day this year. Ossenfort's moves helped Arizona secure a handful of impact players, led by the best receiver in this year's draft in Ohio State's Marvin Harrison Jr. Arizona drafted much-needed pass rush help in Missouri defensive lineman Darius Robinson and Clemson's Xavier Thomas. The Cardinals also added an explosive running back in Florida State's Trey Benson and two cover corners in Rutgers' Max Melton and Boston College's Elijah Jones. The 12 picks by Arizona are the most in a single draft by the team since 1992. —Eric D. Williams
class	fox-sports	atl	c-	Taking quarterback Michael Penix Jr. at No. 8 — after giving Kirk Cousins $100 million guaranteed last month — was easily the most criticized pick of the draft. Giving up a third-round pick to slide up eight spots for DT Ruke Orhorhoro in the second round felt like a reach, though Atlanta made a concerted push to upgrade its defensive front, using five of eight picks there. If Penix finds success in the next two years, it's at the expense of a huge investment in Cousins, and the class as a whole feels underwhelming. —Greg Auman
class	fox-sports	bal	b	To be fair, the Ravens' patience doesn't always pay off — but damn if it isn't impressive anyway. Given their holes on the offensive line, it was interesting when they opted for cornerback Nate Wiggins in the first round. Not to worry; they hung out at the back of the second round and got a starter-caliber tackle in Roger Rosengarten, anyway. Adding deep threat receiver Devontez Walker in the fourth round feels like a sneaky good value, too — which would be a fun development for Lamar Jackson. It's worth noting that Baltimore has yet to find a star edge rusher, but those guys are tough to find when you're consistently picking late. —David Helman
class	fox-sports	buf	b-	Bills GM Brandon Beane might draft for need as much — or more than — any other executive in the NFL. This draft is a perfect example of that. And he addressed those needs in order of priority: receiver (Keon Coleman), safety (Cole Bishop), defensive tackle (DeWayne Carter), running back (Ray Davis) and interior offensive line (Sedrick Van Pran-Granger). I get leery about GMs drafting for need, because it often means they've reached. There's some of that here. But for the most part, there's more to like about this draft. Buffalo's moves back out of the first round allowed Beane to target what he seemed to think was the sweet spot. —Henry McKenna
class	fox-sports	car	b-	Give the Panthers credit for being ambitious, sliding up a spot for WR Xavier Legette, giving up two fifths to get the draft's top running back in Jonathon Brooks in the second. I expected a pass-rusher, and more splash on defense. Tight end Ja'Tavion Sanders felt like good value in a weak class for the position. Even without the No. 1 pick, you expect more impact from a draft after the worst record in the NFL. —Auman
class	fox-sports	chi	a-	The Bears had as good of a draft as they could possibly hope for. They got their quarterback of the future in Caleb Williams and a potential star receiver in Rome Odunze, instantly making him one of, if not the best, No. 3 WR in the league. Chicago's offense now boasts Odunze with veterans DJ Moore and Keenan Allen, as well as D'Andre Swift, Cole Kmet, Gerald Everett and Williams at the helm. On paper, the Bears look to be one of the most complete teams in the league, especially after grabbing a punter with their last original pick. That was a weird gamble, even if Tory Taylor was the best punter in college football last year at Iowa.   Chicago also finally addressed edge by trading back into the draft in the fifth round to take Austin Booker out of Kansas. I don't think he's the unquestioned answer opposite Montez Sweat but can add to the rotation. The confusing priorities at the end of the draft tack on a minus to what is otherwise a near-perfect draft in the Windy City. —Carmen Vitali
class	fox-sports	cin	a	I love the way Cincinnati drafted ahead of time here. They signed Trent Brown for the short term at tackle, but Amarius Mims will hopefully anchor that line for years to come. They brought in Sheldon Rankins in free agency, but they'll be hoping Kris Jenkins and McKinnley Jackson are the future of the defensive front. They still have Tee Higgins on the roster, but Jermaine Burton is an immediate option and could be a long-term replacement. This is how good teams stay on top: planning for the future. —Helman 
class	fox-sports	cle	c	On the downside, the Browns had no first-round pick and just two selections in the top 100, so it was going to be hard to improve the roster. On the bright side, they have a quality roster and are getting starting quarterback Deshaun Watson back from injury, so they don't need a ton. I think Michael Hall and Zak Zinter are good players who bolster the offensive and defensive lines, but that doesn't move the needle much for 2024. This is a vet-heavy team that won't lean much on rookies, from the looks of it. —Helman
class	fox-sports	dal	b	For a team that had so many holes to fill after they did nothing in free agency, the Cowboys made some curious choices. They did a great job plugging two key holes on the O-line (Oklahoma LT Tyler Guyton in Round 1 and Kansas State C Cooper Beebe in Round 2). But no running back? No receiver until Round 6? Instead, in Round 2, they took Western Michigan edge rusher Marshawn Kneeland, who could be terrific in 2025, but might not be a huge help now, when they're supposedly "all-in." Notre Dame LB Marist Liufau felt like a big reach in the third at another position where they needed help. —Vacchiano 
class	fox-sports	den	b-	Denver’s draft is largely a referendum on quarterback Bo Nix, the sixth passer picked in the first 12 slots of the draft. Throwing for 45 touchdowns against three interceptions as a senior at Oregon is impressive, and Denver got his top receiver by taking Troy Franklin in the fourth round. Denver and Sean Payton will have much of their success pinned to how Nix performs. —Auman
class	fox-sports	det	b+	I had wondered if the Lions' draft strategy would change given they had limited needs coming into this weekend. It did, as general manager Brad Holmes pulled off four trades across all three days to get picks for positions of need, using one for cornerback Terrion Arnold out of Alabama at No. 24 overall. Their next pick was also a corner in Missouri's Ennis Rakestraw. Tell me where they saw a need for improvement without telling me. They started Day 3 with a bang by trading a future third to get an international player in tackle Giovanni Manu in the fourth round. I'm not a huge fan of giving up richer future capital, but Holmes has earned the benefit of the doubt. I appreciate that Holmes again got his guys, consensus big board be damned. The Lions also by far and away won the award for best war-room attire. —Vitali
class	fox-sports	gb	b	The Packers entered the 2024 NFL Draft with 11 picks … and ended up making 11 while maneuvering up and down. Jordan Morgan should fit right in on their position-fluid offensive line. Linebacker Edgerrin Cooper can be an excellent complement to Quay Walker. Now that Jeff Hafley is the defensive coordinator, the Packers needed to stock up on his favorite position: safety. They got Xavier McKinney in a splash free agency signing but still drafted three more players at the position. Javon Bullard out of Georgia at No. 58 overall is excellent value. The other big splash was USC running back MarShawn Lloyd, who will go up against his college quarterback twice a year now. Throw in a couple of additional offensive linemen for depth/competition and you have a perfectly solid Green Bay draft. GM Brian Gutekunst is notorious for getting production out of later round picks and this year figures to be no different. —Vitali
class	fox-sports	hou	a-	Texans general manager Nick Caserio set the tone for this draft class by saying that it would be difficult for a rookie to make a significant impact on the 2024 team. That indicated a desire to look for depth and to the future, and Houston definitely achieved that objective at a number of positions: corner, offensive tackle, safety and tight end among them. Second-round pick Kamari Lassiter, one of the top corners in college football last season, should still have a chance to start in Year 1 alongside Derek Stingley. —Ben Arthur
class	fox-sports	ind	c+	Four of the Colts' first five picks addressed the offense. They've done everything they can to make quarterback Anthony Richardson, returning this season after an abbreviated rookie year, as comfortable as possible — and you can't blame them. Receiver Adonai Mitchell represented great value late in the second round. With that being said, Indianapolis could have used a cornerback high. The team has some uncertainty at the spot, which is especially important in the receiver-loaded AFC South. That represents a gamble for Indy. —Arthur 
class	fox-sports	jax	a-	Only time will tell, but the Jaguars had a great draft on paper. They were able to trade down in the first round from 17 to 23 to get Brian Thomas Jr., whom general manager Trent Baalke said would've been the pick at 17. He had been valued by many as a mid-first-round pick. Fourth-rounder Javon Foster, a standout offensive tackle in the SEC, could immediately step in as the No. 3 OT with a chance to be a starter in the future. Jacksonville also leaves the draft with tremendous depth and on the defensive line behind standout trio Josh Allen, Travon Walker and Arik Armstead. —Arthur 
class	fox-sports	kc	a-	Boasting an elite defense, the reigning Super Bowl champion Chiefs entered this draft season needing to get more help for Patrick Mahomes on the offensive side of the ball, especially in the wake of Rashee Rice's legal troubles. They did so in a big way (and Mahomes showed his gratitude to general manager Brett Veach on social media). They added a weapon in Xavier Worthy whose 4.21-second 40-yard dash set an NFL Combine record. That speed figures to be lethal with Mahomes. Kansas City's top three picks were on offense. —Arthur 
class	fox-sports	lvr	b-	Brock Bowers was far and away the draft’s best tight end, and second-rounder Jackson Powers-Johnson can be an immediate starter on the interior offensive line. The Raiders didn’t take a QB, but small-school running back Dylan Laube could be a steal. —Auman
class	fox-sports	lac	a-	New Chargers coach Jim Harbaugh focused on bringing in prospects from Power 5 conferences who played at big-time, winning programs. The centerpiece of the group is Notre Dame offensive tackle Joe Alt, who will play right tackle with Pro Bowler Rashawn Slater staying at left tackle. Second-rounder Ladd McConkey has a chance to take over the lion's share of the targets lost by the departure of Keenan Allen. Third-round selection Junior Colson has experience calling Chargers defensive coordinator Jesse Minter's defense at Michigan. Harbaugh also added picks with famous family ties. Day 3 selection Troy running back Kimani Vidal's great uncle is Hank Aaron. And Hall of Famer Jerry Rice's son Brenden Rice was taken in the seventh round. —Williams
class	fox-sports	lar	b	Sean McVay prepared for life without Aaron Donald by selecting five defensive players, including four who can play along the front seven to generate a pass rush. The Rams selected in the first round for the first time since taking Jared Goff No. 1 overall in 2016, grabbing powerful edge rusher Jared Verse at No. 19. They followed that by taking Verse's teammate at Florida State in the second round in defensive tackle Braden Fiske. Michigan RB Blake Corum gives L.A. a similar runner to spell Pro Bowler Kyren Williams. And Stanford product Josh Karty being selected in the sixth round is L.A.'s latest attempt to solve this team's kicking woes. Overall, the Rams put together a solid class to follow up a very productive group from last year. —Williams 
class	fox-sports	mia	a-	You had to laugh when the Dolphins took Jaylen Wright, the draft's second-fastest running back. Last year, they took Devon Achane, one of the fastest players in the NFL. But that didn't stop them from bringing more speed into the offense in the fourth round. Wright followed a good get in the first round in Chop Robinson, an edge rusher who'll help the team manage snaps for Jaelan Phillips and Bradley Chubb, who both ended last year with major injuries. They also managed to snap up a tackle in Patrick Paul, who will develop behind Terron Armstead. It was a great draft, one that matched value with need. —McKenna 
class	fox-sports	min	a	The Vikings needed a quarterback and got one. Though he likely wasn't their first choice (they reportedly tried to trade up to No. 3 presumably to select Drake Maye), this may have ended up being the ideal scenario. They needed to trade up just one spot from their first pick at No. 11 to select Michigan quarterback J.J. McCarthy.  GM Kwesi Adofo-Mensah was still aggressive with the No. 23 pick, trading up to No. 17 to get Alabama edge Dallas Turner, widely considered one of the best defenders in the draft. Both are arguably top-10 prospects. The drawback is that the Vikings are now extremely low on draft capital next year. They have their first-round pick and just two fifth-round picks. They should expect at least one if not two third-round compensatory picks for losing Kirk Cousins and Danielle Hunter to free agency, but their roster is in solid shape, especially after adding another corner in Khyree Jackson from Oregon and multiple offensive linemen for depth. The Vikings almost certainly won the first round, but they may win the entire draft if McCarthy pans out. —Vitali   
class	fox-sports	ne	b+	Drake Maye didn't have the support he needed when the Patriots took him third overall. And a prospect like Maye — who is high risk, high reward — will need plenty of support to reach his potential. So it's worth crediting executive Eliot Wolf for spending the next four picks (a second, third and two fourths) on offensive players. New England added receivers Ja'Lynn Polk and Javon Baker. The Patriots even doubled up at QB with Joe Milton (Tennessee), another prospect with an incredible arm (albeit with rough accuracy and touch). It's clear the Patriots wanted to prioritize their offense, and it feels like the board lined up with their needs. —McKenna 
class	fox-sports	no	b	The Saints made two strong picks at the top of the class, addressing a glaring need with tackle Taliese Fuaga and moving up to get corner Kool-Aid McKinstry, seen by many as a potential first-round pick. Hit on your first two picks, it's a good draft, but there's not a ton more to this. Spencer Rattler isn't a bad pick, but they used a 2024 fourth to get Jake Haener last year, so will both make the 53 alongside starter Derek Carr? —Auman 
class	fox-sports	nyg	b+	The Giants wanted to trade up for a new franchise QB, but they couldn't do it. So instead they helped out their old one by taking LSU's Malik Nabers, the most explosive WR in the draft, sixth overall. That alone should re-energize their offense. They turned to their secondary on Day 2 and got one of the draft's best safeties in Minnesota's Tyler Nubin (Round 2), but were too late for the top corners when they took Kentucky's Andru Phillips in the third. Penn State TE Theo Johnson (Round 4) could be big for them if veteran Darren Waller retires. —Vacchiano 
class	fox-sports	nyj	b	It was a tough draw that Rome Odunze went at No. 9 — though not unexpected. So the Jets traded down and still added Penn State tackle Olu Fashanu, which made plenty of sense. As good as Tyron Smith is when he's healthy, he's not healthy often. Fashanu will provide much-needed depth at tackle for Smith and Morgan Moses. Brock Bowers might have been tempting because he would instantly start — but I think they'll get more bang for their buck with Fashanu, especially considering how little Aaron Rodgers uses his tight ends. In Round 3, the Jets took a feisty WR in Malachi Corley. New York also added two running backs to their stable — which felt a little unnecessary, but I suppose they went with what the board gave them. —McKenna   
class	fox-sports	phi	a-	Eagles GM Howie Roseman is a wizard. After trying to trade up in the first round for a CB, the top one — Toledo's Quinyon Mitchell — fell right to him at 22. Then he got another corner with a first-round grade by trading up for Iowa's Cooper DeJean in Round 2. That alone would've made it a great weekend for Philly, but Roseman added to it with a Day 3 deal to bring LB Jeremiah Trotter Jr. to his father's old franchise. Their one curious move was taking Houston Christian edge rusher Jalyx Hunt in the third, but the Eagles can afford a high-ceiling project like that. Oh, and all of Roseman's trades got them some 2025 draft capital, too. —Vacchiano
class	fox-sports	pit	a+	If these picks hit, the Steelers' offensive line could be something special. Last year's first-round pick, Broderick Jones, is already showing promise. Pittsburgh has now added two likely starters in Troy Fautanu and Zach Frazier. Fautanu was seen by many as a top-10 prospect, and he fell to the Steelers at 20th overall. It was a similar story for Frazier, whom many rated as a top 40 guy, but fell to No. 51. Throw in fourth-round pick Mason McCormick, and things are looking as good as they have up front in a long time. If that wasn't good enough, the Steelers found themselves a versatile slot receiver in Roman Wilson, who should be ready to contribute right away. If he can stay healthy, it's also a good guess that Payton Wilson's high motor and toughness will make him a fan favorite in Pittsburgh. Those are just bonuses, though. If the Steelers have finally fixed their offensive line, this entire class will have been worth it. —Helman
class	fox-sports	sf	b-	The 49ers picked in the first round for the first time since moving up to take Trey Lance at No. 3 overall in the 2021 draft. Florida receiver Ricky Pearsall was somewhat of a surprise at No. 31, but he gives San Francisco another pass catcher who can operate in the slot and make plays over the middle of the field. The 49ers found a potential cover corner in the second round in Renardo Green and an explosive runner on Day 3 in Louisville's Isaac Guerendo. However, the 49ers needed offensive line help and didn't secure upgrades up front offensively until moving up in the third round to grab promising Kansas offensive lineman Dominick Puni, and later in Day 3 in USC offensive lineman Jarrett Kingston. San Francisco should have focused on this obvious need earlier in the draft. —Williams 
class	fox-sports	sea	b	First-round defensive tackle Byron Murphy is a home-run pick — one of the top defensive players in the draft who should develop into a mainstay on Seattle's defense for the next decade. But Seattle had just two picks in the top 100 because of the Leonard Williams trade, making it tough to secure impact players. Connecticut offensive lineman Christian Haynes should fight for time along the starting offensive line. UTEP linebacker Tyrice Knight is a tackling machine and Michigan's AJ Barner has a chance to earn a role as a blocking tight end. But it appears these late-round picks are more developmental prospects who could take a few years to find roles for Seattle. —Williams 
class	fox-sports	tb	b+	The Bucs made no trades but still pulled in a strong class that hit on key needs. Center Graham Barton leads the way, with edge Chris Braswell, nickel Tykee Smith and receiver Jalen McMillan all in the top 100 picks. There were no trades, no small-school gems to be found, but they brought in potential impact players all over the field. Tampa Bay had the same record as New Orleans, but picked 12 spots later in each round as a result of being division champ.  —Auman   
class	fox-sports	ten	b-	At the top of the draft, the Titans showed a commitment to physicality and owning the trenches with offensive-minded coach Brian Callahan. They've taken on some risk with that approach — they're moving JC Latham from right to left tackle, and nose tackle T'Vondre Sweat has some conditioning concerns — but if it pans out, Tennessee could be looked at as big winners two to three years now. Apart from safety and tight end, the Titans leave the draft having addressed every other need. —Arthur 
class	fox-sports	was	b+	Rule No. 1 of drafting a franchise QB: surround him with help. But that's not really what the Commanders did after drafting LSU QB Jayden Daniels second overall. They turned to their defense, where they did get great second-round value in Illinois DT Jer'Zhan Newton and Michigan CB Mike Sainristil. Both could be big-time players. The same goes for second-round TE Ben Sinnott. All their top picks were excellent, but their O-line is still a glaring issue and they didn't address that until Round 3 with TCU guard Brandon Coleman. That could turn out to be a regrettable decision. —Ralph Vacchiano 
class	yahoo-sports	dal	c+	This draft went about how most people expected. The Cowboys got a potential Tyron Smith replacement in the first round, added front seven help and got depth on the offensive line. This draft might not have huge immediate returns for the Cowboys, but they made some strong dice rolls on future starters. The team sits in limbo as Jerry Jones decides what he wants to do next with his franchise, making this an important draft for the Cowboys to nail. 
class	yahoo-sports	nyg	b+	The Giants wanted a quarterback, but they still came away with a solid group of players despite not taking one. Malik Nabers is the receiver they’ve needed for quite some time and they found a solid replacement for Xavier McKinney in Tyler Nubin. Theo Johnson is a smart draft pick in response to Darren Waller being unsure about his playing future. The Giants might not have been able to make the splash they wanted but they should feel good about where they stand. 
class	yahoo-sports	phi	a-	The Eagles played the draft so well. They let Quinyon Mitchell fall right into their lap with the 22nd overall pick and he has all the tools necessary to be a CB1 in the NFL. Then, they jumped back up in Round 2 to grab the falling Cooper DeJean. Taking swings on Ainias Smith and Johnny Wilson on the third day of the draft might work for them and they made the feel-good selection of Jeremiah Trotter Jr. They also added a couple picks in 2025, including a future third-round selection from the Dolphins. Well played, Howie Roseman. 
class	yahoo-sports	was	b	It’s a new day for the Commanders. They have a new franchise quarterback, a couple impact defenders and even a freak athlete on the offensive line to develop. The Jayden Daniels pick is risky based on his prospect profile, but he still should be a drastic upgrade over what they had in Sam Howell last season. This class hinges on Daniels being a top-tier starter, but they did grab some solid players in the draft. This draft class should make fans feel more hopeful after a shaky free agency period.
class	yahoo-sports	chi	a	You made it, Bears fans. A quarterback prospect who has real deal superstar upside is here. Caleb Williams has all the talent in the world to finally be the dynamic passer the Bears have been waiting for — and he is set up well for success. They drafted Rome Odunze with their second top-10 pick and a developmental tackle in the third round with Kiran Amegadjie. Even their fifth-round selection of Austin Booker was quality! This draft class can be so impactful that it gets an A even with picking a punter in the fourth round. 
class	yahoo-sports	det	b	Detroit made some great picks in the first two rounds of the draft and some risky ones to kick off Day 3. They accomplished their goal of getting better at cornerback this offseason, now featuring a completely revamped room as Terrion Arnold and Ennis Rakestraw Jr. will join Carlton Davis in Detroit. The Lions even got a couple sixth-rounders with potential to close out their day. It’s really just the selections in the fourth round that are giving a bit of pause here. 
class	yahoo-sports	gb	b	The Packers made a ton of draft picks and came out looking pretty good. Their linebacker picks were questionable (although the entire linebacker class was down this year), but they found a potential franchise left tackle in Jordan Morgan at the end of the first round. They took three safeties as well and might have a tough, versatile duo now between Javon Bullard and Xavier McKinney. MarShawn Lloyd is a quality addition at running back while they test Josh Jacobs for at least a season. 
class	yahoo-sports	min	c+	The Vikings went all in and got their quarterback and edge rusher of the future. Whew. As a result, they barely have any 2025 picks. They do have some talented prospects at key positions to build around. J.J. McCarthy and Dallas Turner can be solid NFL players, but the Vikings paid a high price to attain them. Right now, the only top-100 pick they’re slated to have in 2025 is their first-round pick (with at least one third-round compensatory pick coming their way for Kirk Cousins). This better work! 
class	yahoo-sports	atl	d-	Baffling. Pretty baffling use of the eighth overall pick. After signing Kirk Cousins, it was a bit of a shocker for the Falcons to use the pick on a backup quarterback rather than take someone who can play this year. Unless the Cousins signing is a total disaster, it will be years before the Falcons see Michael Penix Jr. on the field. This team is not ready for a resource allocation like that. The Falcons also failed to grab a cornerback in this draft, but they made some very solid picks along the defensive line that should help them finally stabilize that position group. The defensive line picks are the only thing keeping this from being an F grade.
class	yahoo-sports	car	c	The Panthers took some risks in this draft class. It’s hard to say whether it’s bad or good because making risky draft picks is not inherently a bad thing. Carolina decided to spend its picks taking home-run swings that have low floors and big upside. The gambles are fun, but the Panthers' early draft picks have shaky profiles in one way or another. Even though they’re getting a C, it’s hard not to be caught by the allure of the unknown here. It’s a really interesting class. 
class	yahoo-sports	no	b-	All those trades in the past left the Saints with only two picks in the top 100 of the draft and they went over 100 selections in between their own picks at one point. Still, the Saints grabbed an immediate starter at guard or tackle in Taliese Fuaga. He is another member of an extremely talented offensive line class that should have success in the NFL. The Saints grabbed a starting-caliber cornerback in Kool-Aid McKinstry and a developmental option at quarterback in Spencer Rattler. For as few draft assets as they came into the draft with, the Saints fared pretty well.
class	yahoo-sports	tb	b+	Really solid draft for the Buccaneers. Offensive lineman Graham Barton is one of the cleanest prospects in the draft and can play all five positions up front. This is a terrific player to pair with Tristan Wirfs. The Bucs also grabbed a solid wide receiver prospect in Jalen McMillan and a quality running back in Bucky Irving. How linebacker Chris Braswell and defensive back Tykee Smith develop will be important for the overall impact of this draft class. This is a nice haul for the Buccaneers. 
class	yahoo-sports	arz	b+	Shoutout to Arizona for not overthinking it. Grab the best player in the draft and keep it moving. They took some chances with the selections of Max Melton, Trey Benson and Xavier Thomas, giving them more credible prospects to continue this rebuild. The Cardinals might not win the division this season, but this draft class should help them get to competing for the playoffs soon, especially if Kyler Murray can build on his late-season resurgence. 
class	yahoo-sports	lar	b-	This was a safe, logical draft for the Rams, which makes sense for where they are now. They beefed up their defensive line, added a quality back and also a much-needed safety within the top 100 picks. There isn’t a lot of big upside here, but most of these players should have high floors for the NFL. It’s hard to see this draft class failing for the Rams, but they might not have true star power here.
class	yahoo-sports	sf	c-	Weird draft class for the 49ers, but it might not matter. They’ve turned a former "Mr. Irrelevant" into one of the most productive quarterbacks in the NFL. Ricky Pearsall was a surprise and head coach Kyle Shanahan made his patented mid-round running back pick. Yet it’s hard to look at a draft class that has Pearsall as a first-round selection and feel super great about it. Dominick Puni is a name to watch for them as a long-term developmental offensive guard. He’s has the movement skills Shanahan likes in his linemen.
class	yahoo-sports	sea	c+	Mixed feelings is the best way to describe the Seahawks' draft. They grabbed a potentially disruptive defensive lineman in Byron Murphy II — a piece they desperately needed. They also found someone who can compete for a starting role on the offensive line with Christian Haynes in the third round. Still, their Day 3 picks leave a bit to be desired, especially with no second-round pick this year due to the Leonard Williams trade.
class	yahoo-sports	buf	c+	The Bills played this draft safe and took home 10 players, although only one wide receiver in Keon Coleman. Even though Coleman didn’t have the cleanest end to his season and a slow 40-yard dash time at the scouting combine, he still has shown serious talent in college football. Coleman will start right away for the Bills and will immediately have a chance to prove whether he can separate from NFL cornerbacks. The Bills had another solid pickup in Ray Davis, but other than that this draft class was just fine. Probably not too many movers and shakers, but some quality players at positions of need. It will be interesting to see what happens with Travis Clayton, a developmental offensive line prospect from England.
class	yahoo-sports	mia	b+	It's a strong draft haul for the Dolphins. They found a potential 10-sack edge rusher with Chop Robinson in the first round and grabbed a future starter at offensive tackle with Patrick Paul. Their trade-up for Jaylen Wright in the fourth was perplexing. Overall this is still a good group of players. Malik Washington and Tahj Washington are two wide receivers who had a lot of buzz in college and could compete for reps behind Tyreek Hill and Jaylen Waddle.
class	yahoo-sports	ne	a-	New England had a tough decision to make on how it wanted to start its rebuild and it ultimately turned down a boatload of draft picks to stay at the top of the draft and pick Drake Maye. Maye has ridiculous upside and gives the Patriots a playmaking option while they fill out the rest of their roster. Ja’Lynn Polk and Javon Baker should compete for starting reps in one of the weaker wide receiver rooms in the league. Joe Milton III is an intriguing pick in the sixth round and it’ll at least be fun to track his development. If just one of their offensive line picks hit, this could be the foundation for a new run of excellence in New England.
class	yahoo-sports	nyj	b-	The Jets didn’t have a ton of draft capital to work with, but they still found some quality players, including a potential franchise tackle in Olu Fashanu from Penn State. He’ll be a fixture up front for a long, long time if the injury issues from last season don’t reappear. Wideout Malachi Corley will make fans happy early with his ability to run after the catch and Braelon Allen is a talented running back to develop behind Breece Hall. The trade up for QB Jordan Travis was baffling, but that was in the fifth round so no need to ding too much in the grand scheme of things.
class	yahoo-sports	bal	b+	Once again, the Ravens walked away with a strong draft class after letting players fall right into their laps. They started things off with Clemson cornerback Nate Wiggins and doubled back at the position with a potential huge steal by grabbing Iowa State cornerback T.J. Tampa in the fourth round. Tampa was projected to go much higher. The Ravens should also have a Day 1 starter at right tackle in Roger Rosengarten from Washington. They even found some quality depth they can develop on the edge with Penn State’s Adisa Isaac. The Ravens, as usual, didn’t overthink it and it looks like a great new crop of rookies.
class	yahoo-sports	cin	b+	The Bengals should be happy with how they played the first two days of the draft. Amarius Mims has the ability to be a decade-long starter at either tackle spot — if he can stay on the field. Kris Jenkins is a quality body on the defensive line and Jermaine Burton is an explosive playmaker who gives the Bengals flexibility at wide receiver. McKinnley Jackson might have been a reach to close the third round but the Bengals walked away with immediate impact and long-term potential at key spots.
class	yahoo-sports	cle	b	The Browns didn’t make their first pick until nearly the end of the second round, taking ultra-athletic defensive tackle Michael Hall Jr. from Ohio State. They added offensive line depth, picked a wide receiver and found some dart throws on defense in the sixth and seventh rounds. You can’t be too mad given the amount of capital they held walking into the draft.
class	yahoo-sports	pit	a	The Steelers looked at their offensive line from last year and emphatically said “never again!” Their two first draft picks were on the o-line and then they came back for a third time to kick off the fourth round. Payton Wilson has his concerns in terms of injury, but he was a great playmaker for NC State. Getting him with the 98th overall pick is a great spot for Pittsburgh. Quarterback will be the ultimate decider in how the Steelers' season turns out, but they may have found two impact starters on the offensive line in Troy Fautanu and Zach Frazier.
class	yahoo-sports	jax	c	The Jaguars' offseason has been just OK and the draft followed suit. They did a great job moving down from their original spot in Round 1 of the draft while still landing a big-time wide receiver prospect, which they needed after clumsily letting Calvin Ridley walk to a divisional rival in free agency. Beyond that, it doesn’t seem like they got too much positive impact, but if Thomas is the final key that allows the Jaguars’ passing game to be consistent in the future, it’s fine. Getting Trevor Lawrence another receiver was priority No. 1 and they might have gotten the best of the second wave of wide receivers.
class	yahoo-sports	hou	b	The Texans didn’t have a first-round pick, but they still grabbed a few quality players, including a starting nickel corner and developmental offensive tackle. Their first four picks have a chance to be immediate contributors, which is all you can ask for without a pick on the first day. It’s not the sexy draft that the Texans had last year when they nabbed C.J. Stroud and Will Anderson Jr., but it’s a draft that will help strengthen the team's foundation.
class	yahoo-sports	ten	c+	The Titans nailed their first pick, but could have done better the rest of the way. JC Latham is a “set it and forget it” type of offensive tackle who is already penciled in as a starter. It’ll be interesting to see how Latham handles being a left tackle in the NFL. He has enough talent to be successful. Getting Cedric Gray in the fourth round could be a long-term steal for the Titans, but overall it wasn’t a draft class to get excited about unless T’Vondre Sweat develops into a pass rusher.
class	yahoo-sports	ind	b+	This was a productive draft class for the Colts. They found the edge rusher they needed in Laiatu Latu and may have gotten a steal with the Adonai Mitchell pick in the second round. Depth along the offensive line was a need they filled as well and Anthony Gould in the fifth round may be a steal at wide receiver. If Anthony Richardson can stay healthy and build on what he accomplished as a rookie, the Colts might be able to actually get into the playoffs with the additions in this draft class.
class	yahoo-sports	den	d	Sorry, Broncos fans. There's no other way to slice this. The Broncos made some fantastic selections on the second and third days of the draft, but taking Bo Nix with the 12th overall pick is a head-scratcher. Nix wasn’t a prospect who was highly in demand and his ceiling appears limited in the NFL. Nix should win the starting job over Jarrett Stidham and Zach Wilson, but Nix will need to develop a level of playmaking that wasn’t really there on his college tape. Maybe head coach Sean Payton is right and he can make Nix the next Drew Brees, but that’s selling the peak of Brees’ play awfully short. It's a strange start for the Broncos as they kick off their rebuild. Outside of Nix, they may have found immediate, quality contributors with Utah edge rusher Jonah Elliss, Oregon WR Troy Franklin and Notre Dame RB Audric Estime. Franklin and Estime are younger prospects with legitimate upside.
class	yahoo-sports	kc	a	Hell of a draft for the back-to-back defending champs. They added elite, gamebreaking speed with their selection of Xavier Worthy in the first round and might have found a franchise left tackle in the second. Jared Wiley and Jaden Hicks were quality pickups in Round 4 and they took a couple dart throws on the offensive line later on. Wiley has the potential to be the Chiefs' starting tight end after Travis Kelce moves on, showing off rare movement ability for a 6-foot-6 player. Worthy, Kingsley Suamataia and Wiley may be cornerstones for the Chiefs’ offense when this is all said and done.
class	yahoo-sports	lvr	b	The Raiders got a couple of impact players on offense, even if the fit isn’t immediately clear. Brock Bowers has superstar potential in the NFL. Figuring out how he’ll mesh with Michael Mayer and where their skills can be used simultaneously will be an interesting challenge for the Raiders’ coaching staff. Jackson Powers-Johnson should be a good fixture on the offensive line for the next few years and Delmar Glaze may wind up being a starter too. Solid first Raiders draft for general manager Tom Telesco and head coach Antonio Pierce. Now it’s time to figure out how the pieces fit together.
class	yahoo-sports	lac	b+	People might not like the Chargers taking an offensive tackle over a wide receiver with the fifth overall pick, but this is not a team that was a player away from getting to the top. They went 5-12 last season for a reason, mainly because they weren’t that good. The Chargers needed help everywhere, including offensive tackle, and got a franchise player in Joe Alt. He and Rashawn Slater will form a tremendously talented tackle duo to protect Justin Herbert and help head coach Jim Harbaugh get his offense off the ground in Los Angeles. They still grabbed an explosive wide receiver at the top of the second and a speedy linebacker from Michigan in the third round. The Chargers will need time to restock their roster with talent.
