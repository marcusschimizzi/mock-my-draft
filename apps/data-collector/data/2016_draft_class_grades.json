Once thought to be a first-round pick, Ragland fell to the second where his clean run-stopping ability makes him a solid pick. While there are questions about his athleticism in coverage, he can make plays in front of him in zone, and his pass-rush ability can help him find a role on third down (he is movable blitzer, and the Bills can isolate him on running backs). Washington is another strong pick from a production standpoint, as he played all over Ohio State's defensive front the last two years and he posted third third-best pass rush grade among the draft's interior defensive linemen in 2015. Jones has a cannon for an arm and he's worth a developmental shot, even though his accuracy between six and 30 yards is among the worst in the class. Jonathan Williams missed all of 2015, but his 101.9 elusive rating ranked fifth in the FBS in 2014. Listenbee is a nice late-round speed addition as he may be the fastest player in the draft and it showed on the field when he was healthy in 2014 (526 deep yards, 10th in the nation).",

The film shows the potential with Howard, whose length and speed make him an intriguing option at outside corner, but there were enough bad plays on tape to give him the No. 16 coverage grade in the class. Drake has good straight-line speed and he can catch the ball out of the backfield (his 2.07 yards per route run ranked third in the class), while also adding kick-return value. Carroo was outstanding on only 363 snaps last year, leading the class with 4.11 yards per route run, dropping only two passes and taking over multiple games (Michigan State comes to mind). He can separate at the intermediate level to add another option to Miami's passing game. Carroo was drafted a day late as he's a good intermediate route runner with sure hands and he led all FBS receivers with 4.11 yards per route. Grant picked up more yards after the catch than any receiver in the class, and he adds a playmaking option from the slot.

He graded at -24.7 as a freshman, -41.0 as a sophomore and -12.1 as a junior, all among the worst QB grades in the nation. Hackenberg's accuracy has also been among the nation's worst, to all levels of the field, and he will have to make major strides to live up to his second-round value.

Schematically, it's a curious pick, as New York played pure man coverage only 30.4 percent of the time last year, 21st in the league, so unless the Giants are going to increase that number, Apple's weaknesses playing in off coverage and in space may get exposed. We had two corners ranked higher on our board than Apple in William Jackson III and Mackensie Alexander. One of the best route-runners in the class, Shepard posted the top overall grade among the nation's wide receivers a year ago. He's a shifty slot receiver, but he has shown the downfield ball skills (caught 64.7 percent of his deep attempts) to win on the outside as well. Thompson is good value in the third, as he can complement last year's second-round safety, Landon Collins. He ranked fifth in college safety grades in the class. Perkins was one of the best picks on Day 3 as he led all running backs with an elusive rating of 114.7. Adams was our second-rated tight end in the class as he's the top inline blocker with good speed and route running to stretch the seam. The Giants did a nice job with their late picks.",

He has the big arm to drive deep outs and comebacks, and those skills should be put to use in a vertical passing system 15- to 25-yard range. He graded well on a snap-for-snap basis, but there are concerns with his timing, deep accuracy and ability to make plays under pressure. Wentz goes to a good situation with a coaching staff that is well-versed in developing various styles of quarterback. Seumalo is one of our favorite guards, as he rarely loses in the running game, and he only surrendered four pressures last year despite starting the last three games at left tackle. Smallwood is a good zone runner and he posted the 11th-best run grade in the class. Vaitai had the 16th-best grade in the tackle class in 2014, posting positives in pass protection and the run game, but his work in the run game took a step back in 2015. McCalister is a pass-rush specialist that picked up pressure to the outside at the seventh-best rate in the class, but he has no power to his game as a rusher or against the run.",

He'll make some impressive blocks and some ugly ones, evening off to his +0.8 overall grade that ranked 28th in the class last year. Killebrew brings great range as an underneath zone defender, but he has to tie up some tackling issues. Dahl posted strong grades in pass protection and he should get a chance to stick as offensive tackle to see if he can learn to handle his kryptonite \u2014 the bull rush. Rudock had a fantastic second half and he's worth a look to see if it's sustainable after a terrible first half of the season.
