    "text": "If examining the Arizona Cardinals' draft class in a vacuum, it's hard not to like what the team has done. Even with Arizona only getting a late second-rounder for 2018 first-round pick Josh Rosen, the draft was still a big win. The Cardinals got themselves their quarterback of the future in Kyler Murray. They also got some weapons for the reigning Heisman winner in the form of receivers Andy Isabella, Hakeem Butler and KeeSean Johnson. This should give new head coach Kliff Kingsbury the tools he needs to run the offense he wants. \"Whether it was the plan or just value lining up right, it's a sign that the Cardinals didn't just hire Kingsbury, they truly believe in his offense and are willing to invest fully into it,\" Frank Schwab of Yahoo Sports wrote after the draft. \"They're not doing this halfway.\" This was not purely an offensive draft for Arizona, though. The Cardinals grabbed a probable Day 1 starter at the top of Round 2 in Byron Murphy. They also grabbed Deionte Thompson in Round 5, a guy with the tools to be a starting NFL safety sooner rather than later. The Cardinals were bad last season. Really bad. Thanks to this draft, they should immediately be on the upswing.",

They reached for players more than once, and they allowed themselves to be outmaneuvered early. Houston needed offensive line help in the worst way. Quarterback Deshaun Watson was sacked an alarming 62 times in 2018, which is bad for any quarterback. For a quarterback coming off a torn ACL and with a propensity to take unnecessary hits? That's disastrous. The Texans needed to land lineman who were ready to contribute right away, such as Washington State offensive tackle Andre Dillard. They got leapfrogged by the Philadelphia Eagles for Dillard in Round 1, however, and settled for Alabama State's Tytus Howard. Howard has the potential to become a very good NFL player—he has as much upside as anyone in the draft. He's a bit of a project, though. As is second-round tackle Max Scharping of Northern Illinois. These two may be perennial Pro Bowlers, but if Watson suffers another significant injury while they are learning on the job, it could derail all of the momentum the franchise generated in 2018.",

Though they originally considered moving up for Ohio State signal-caller Dwayne Haskins, the Redskins were able to sit back and land him at 15: Washington then moved back into the first round to grab Mississippi State's Montez Sweat, whom some considered the best pass-rusher in the draft. It only cost Washington the 46th overall pick and a 2020 second-rounder to grab Sweat. The Redskins then went and got Haskins a familiar target in Ohio State wideout Terry McLaurin, added a potential starting running back—depending on the health of Derrius Guice—in Stanford's Bryce Love and a developmental receiver in Kelvin Harmon. Washington has drafted a foundation for the future offense around Haskins, added a top-tier sack artist and did it all without overpaying or overdrafting.",

Sure, he lacks size, but his talent reminds me of DeSean Jackson, who was also under 170 pounds at the NFL Scouting Combine when he came out. If Brown has that sort of career, the Ravens will have done well. Plus, they gained two Day 3 picks (Nos. 127 and 197) by trading down three spots in a deal with the Eagles and still selecting the guy they likely wanted at No. 22. Ferguson joins former third-round pick Tim Williams as a developing pass rusher for the Ravens. Ferguson could have gone much earlier, so I suspect Baltimore fans will come to appreciate his talents. Adding a larger receiver in Boykin made sense with the lack of wideout depth for Ravens. Hill brings speed and underrated toughness to complement Mark Ingram. Powers could take over for Marshal Yanda as a starter eventually. Marshall was a great pick for Baltimore because they will eventually need to replace Jimmy Smith and Brandon Carr. Mack is yet another sparkplug in the middle for the Ravens. McSorley would seem to fit the Ravens' current offense and could contribute at another position, if needed.",

Surprisingly, GM Thomas Dimitroff did not manage to move up for a defensive tackle like Ed Oliver or Christian Wilkins to meet their top need. Lindstrom is a safe pick and an upgrade over the veteran free agents the team signed, but they could have used another difference-maker on defense. Then they picked McGary, who I figured Dimitroff was targeting in the top 45 to replace former starting right tackle Ryan Schraeder. They gave up a third-round pick (No. 79) and gained a sixth-round pick (No. 203) in this deal, which isn't a terrible price to pay if McGary protects Matt Ryan as an immediate starter. In the end, they basically copied what Indianapolis did to its offensive line in the 2018 draft (Colts picked Quenton Nelson and Braden Smith). The Falcons had no picks on Friday night. They addressed the cornerback spot with the raw Sheffield and tough-minded Miller. Cominsky reminds me of former Pro Bowler Jared Allen, who was also a fourth-round pick. Ollison is the power back they desired to join Devonta Freeman and Ito Smith, though most expected fellow Pitt RB Darrin Hall to be drafted first.",

They met their need for an offensive tackle in the early second round, giving up a third-round selection to move up 10 spots and select Little. He should help protect Cam Newton and Grier, a third-round selection who will likely beat out the team's current backup QBs for a job. Miller is a stiff defender with an injury history, but the Panthers hope he can avoid the training room to reach his potential. Scarlett is a power back who will pair well with Christian McCaffrey. Daley's a swing tackle prospect that the team coveted. Godwin excelled at the East-West Shrine Game, which may be more indicative of his talent than his average workout numbers.",

There wasn't another pass rusher available in the first round for which the Saints could have waited, but a wide receiver like D.J. Moore or Calvin Ridley could have helped the team in 2018 and beyond (and would have cost less draft capital). Davenport must excel as a pass rusher over the next three years to make this deal worthwhile. Once again, the Saints traded future draft capital to land a player they wanted when they moved next year's second-round pick as part of the deal to land McCoy. He was a first-round value that they picked in the middle of Round 2, and Drew Brees needed a sturdy and smart pivot. Could they have found a center later in the draft without giving up a future second-rounder? Gardner-Johnson is a versatile safety who presented nice value in the early fourth round, so they traded up to get him. Finding talents like Elliss and Mack in the seventh round could pay immediate dividends.",

Thankfully, his talent was not overlooked due to the diminished value that's often placed on his position. If Josh Allen becomes a star pass rusher, though, Tampa Bay fans will wonder \"what if?\" Bunting could be a good player for Tampa Bay, but there were other corners of higher value available in the early second round. Dean's film was quite inconsistent, but the team thought his potential on the outside was worthy of a third-round choice. The secondary got more help with Edwards, a starter-quality safety who will compete for playing time sooner than later. However, the Bucs ignored needs at running back, wideout, and offensive line to pick those defensive backs. Nelson will be a starting power end in the NFL for many years. They certainly needed a kicker, though I don't believe Gay is the best in the draft and I figured they would wait until Round 6 or 7 to address the position. The team may see Miller as its new Adam Humphries. Beckner flashes great talent inside.",

    "text": "New head coach Kliff Kingsbury decided to bring in \"his quarterback\" rather than work with 2018 first-round pick Josh Rosen. I can't blame him. Coaching in the NFL is difficult enough without passing up a quarterback you believe in. Josh Rosen might succeed in Miami, and I hope he does, but taking Murray first overall was the right move for Kingsbury and the Cardinals. Forget about 40 times -- Murphy has great ball skills and instincts, and he and Patrick Peterson will make a strong starting cornerback duo on the outside. Moving Rosen for a late second-round pick was fantastic, given the circumstances. Using that pick on Isabella will be questioned in some war rooms, especially with 2018 second-rounder Christian Kirk already playing a similar role on the team. Getting Allen in the third was fantastic -- he's a Calais Campbell-type bargain who gives his all on every down. The fact that the Larry Fitzgerald era will eventually end forced the team to take advantage of Butler and Johnson as excellent values in the fourth and sixth rounds, respectively. I wasn't as high as many on Thompson, but selecting him in the fifth provides nice value at a position of need. Gaillard was one of the better deals on Saturday. Miles and Dogbe are strong and nasty linemen (offensive and defensive, respectively) who I expected to go earlier. Getting Wilson as Mr. Irrelevant was smart, as they needed a tight end, and he would have been coveted as a free agent.",

I liked that the Rams picked up a third (No. 79, in addition to the 45th overall pick) in the deal. Additional moves took L.A. out of the top 60 selections. Rapp is simply a heady football player who finds his way to the ball despite possessing average athleticism for the position. I suspect he'll be a long-term starter once Eric Weddle retires (or if the veteran can't stay healthy this year). Henderson's size was brought up in the process, but guys had a hard time tackling his compact build. L.A. needed depth at corner, and Long was a good value in the third round. Evans isn't an elite athlete, but he could be a fair swing tackle, which the Rams need. Gaines is a top-notch nose who won't just stand there on pass plays -- quarterbacks will know he's there. Edwards joined Evans to add names to a lean offensive-line depth chart.",

Adding him to a D-line that already includes Dee Ford means the Niners will greatly improve their pass rush, as they generated just 37 sacks in 2018 (bottom third of the league). Bosa's power comes into play as a pass rusher and run defender, and his career floor comparison is Chris Long -- that's pretty, pretty good. Samuel's ability to work inside and outside, his toughness, and his strong hands made him a no-brainer pick for the receiver-needy Niners in Round 2. Hurd could be a big steal if he continues to grow as a receiver. The selection of two wideouts was somewhat expected, given their lack of talent at the position. Wishnowsky was the top punter in the draft, so the Niners picked him up earlier than expected on Saturday. He likely was not the top player available on most teams' boards. Greenlaw brings speed to the team's defense. Smith is a solid tight end to back up George Kittle. Harris suffered through injuries in college but has starter potential.",

With the extra pick they gained by trading edge rusher Frank Clark to the Chiefs, the Seahawks selected Collier, who is a very similar player. Forget about his 4.91 40 time -- he'll be a stout run defender and powerful pass rusher. Then, GM John Schneider acquired even more draft capital by trading the 30th overall selection to the Giants for a second-, a fourth- and a fifth-round pick. The Seahawks apparently did not want to pick early as they moved down again to gain additional picks before selecting their guy at safety (Blair). Metcalf could be an Alshon Jeffery-type bargain for the Seahawks if he reaches his potential as a big-time downfield playmaker. Teams loved the intelligence and athleticism of Barton, and it's not surprising the Seahawks found him intriguing. Jennings is a solid mid-round receiver who bolsters the depth for recently-signed Russell Wilson. Haynes jumped up boards with nice workouts after being a sturdy, reliable player for Wake Forest for four years. Amadi is as tough and versatile as they come in the secondary, and Burr-Kirven will be a special teams star. Homer is a speed back to complement Chris Carson and Rashaad Penny.",
