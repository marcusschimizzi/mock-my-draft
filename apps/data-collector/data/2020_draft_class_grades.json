    "text": "Look at this Ravens roster. Where are the holes? Definitely middle linebacker. Maybe wide receiver. Probably a guard to replace Marshal Yanda. But that's it. So I liked that the Ravens got an off-ball linebacker at No. 28 whom Lamar Jackson called \"Ray Lewis Jr.,\" and I liked that they didn't have to move up to get him. Patrick Queen started only 16 games in his LSU career, but his talent bursts on the tape. He's a fit as a long-term C.J. Mosley replacement. (By the way: Baltimore has now drafted three linebackers in the first round: Lewis in 1996, Mosley in 2014 and Queen. Those first two were/are pretty good.)\n\nThe Ravens entered this draft with three picks in the first two rounds, and they ended up with five total picks on Day 2. Here are those picks, along with where I had them in my overall rankings:\n\n55. J.K. Dobbins, RB, Ohio State (27 on my board)\n71. Justin Madubuike, DT, Texas A&M (42)\n92. Devin Duvernay, WR, Texas (64)\n98. Malik Harrison, LB, Ohio State (74)\n106. Tyre Phillips, OT Mississippi State (83)\n\nSo as you can see, all five of them were at least 20 spots higher on my final Big Board. That's outstanding value. Baltimore fortified the middle of its defense -- it gave up 4.4 yards per carry last season, most in franchise history -- got a playmaker to help Jackson in the slot, and picked a tackle with guard experience who could compete to take over for Yanda, along with fourth-round pick Ben Bredeson (143). I'm also a big fan of James Proche (201), a super-productive pass-catcher who could fill a role, and safety Geno Stone (219) could be a special-teams menace as a rookie. Getting him in the seventh round is stellar.\n\nGeneral manager Eric DeCosta had another really strong draft. Expect Baltimore to be a Super Bowl contender again.",

Still, general manager Chris Ballard has done a good job of stocking the roster with talent since he took over in 2017.

The Cardinals defense was the big winner of Day 1 in the draft, though. Isaiah Simmons will join the Cards as an elite athlete after doing a little bit of everything for Clemson. For those who think Simmons will be a safety in the NFL, general manager Steve Keim had a different take on how he sees his new star. \"The only guy I could think of, with similarities, was Brian Urlacher when he came out,\" Keim said on the Cardinals' draft livestream. He was a safety at New Mexico, for the most part ... not quite as fast, but a guy who became a great player and who made that ascension to playing more in the box. The Birds didn't have a pick in the second round because it was the centerpiece of the deal that brought them Hopkins. They spent their third-round selection on a tackle who was getting first-round hype throughout the predraft process in Josh Jones. If he comes anywhere near his ceiling, he's the steal of the third round. The Day 3 selections were largely spent filling out the depth chart in the front seven. Eno Benjamin is an intriguing pass-catching back who could find a role as a Drake backup. There's a lot to love about Arizona's performance.",

Marlon Davidson is an interesting prospect. Everyone talks about versatility in the secondary, but he is a 300-pounder who primarily played defensive end in a four-man front at Auburn. So he's built like a 3-technique but played on the edge in college. He'll be an interesting fit alongside Grady Jarrett on the inside. Matt Hennessy continued the \"solid\" theme with this class. He's unlikely to be a perennial Pro Bowler but should become a consistent starter. Not a lot to hate in this group, but there isn't much to love either.",

Lamar Jackson has to feel fantastic about his future with an organization that clearly knows how to maximize its title window with him at quarterback. Baltimore kicked off Day 1 by patiently waiting and snagging a player in Patrick Queen who is arguably the best linebacker not named Isaiah Simmons in the whole draft. J.K. Dobbins doesn't fill a need, but the running back does make their offense more terrifying. As much as the Ravens run the ball, Dobbins' explosiveness makes him an especially good fit. Having four selections in the third round gave the Ravens the luxury of taking Dobbins in the second, as they still addressed important needs. Justin Madubuike could become a disruptive force in the middle, Devin Duvernay may be constrained to the slot, but that doesn't matter in the third round. Malik Harrison is limited in coverage but could do damage as a blitzing linebacker in the Ravens' blitz-happy defense. Ben Bredeson and Tyre Phillips were rated similarly on Matt Miller's big board, so Phillips may have been a bit of a reach, but both will bring new blood to an offensive line that needs it on the interior.",

They needed a true No. 1 receiver for Josh Allen to find out if he can be the quarterback of the future. With their second-round pick, they got a guy who was widely considered a first-rounder in A.J. Epenesa. The edge-rusher's production at Iowa was great (22 sacks, 30.5 tackles for loss over the past two seasons), but concerns about his athleticism caused him to drop. His testing wasn't ideal and revealed him to be an almost purely power rusher. How that translates to the NFL is questionable. There aren't many Frank Clarks in the league. Zack Moss will offer depth in the running back rotation with Frank Gore out of the picture. Jake Fromm was an interesting choice given Allen's profile as a big (6'5\", 237 lbs), strong-armed quarterback, and the 6'2\", 219-pound Fromm certainly isn't that. If you're of the thinking that Epenesa is a steal, then this class looks good.

Ruggs is an incredibly gifted athlete who showed steady hands at Alabama. He was also the team's No. 3 receiver throughout his time there, so it's surprising he was the first wideout taken—even over teammate Jerry Jeudy. You'd be hard-pressed to find a mock draft with Arnette in the first round, but the Ohio State cornerback did showcase some toughness while playing with an injured wrist for a large portion of 2019. Lynn Bowden Jr. is the modern-day Kordell Stewart or Antwaan Randle-El, depending on what era you'd like to look back on. He played quarterback in college but will be a receiver/gadget player for the Raiders. Bryan Edwards is a talented receiver but dealt with a knee injury that probably dropped his stock.

So getting good pieces in this draft was incredibly important. The results were mixed. Cam Akers is an intriguing running back in part because he played behind a horrendous offensive line at Florida State. Daniel Jeremiah of NFL Network said he could \"walk down the street here outside my house, and I can promise you I could find a very similar offensive line to the one he ran behind at Florida State.\" Yet, Akers still ran for over 1,144 yards and 14 touchdowns. He will continue to run behind a bad line, as the Rams had the 31st-ranked unit at PFF last season. Swapping out Todd Gurley for Akers won't fix the running game, even if it does help their wallet. Wide receiver Van Jefferson will be much cheaper than Brandin Cooks ($8 million in 2020). However, the pick was a questionable value at No. 57. Jefferson was a four-year player at Florida but never offered elite production, topping out at 657 yards receiving last year. He's a good route-runner but offers little athletic upside. The team's best picks came in the third round. Terrell Lewis was one of the higher-upside pass-rushing specialists in the draft. He has the length, athleticism and technique to be a double-digit sack artist. He presumably dropped down boards because of injury concerns. Terrell Burgess is a versatile defender on the back end. It wouldn't be surprising to see both Lewis and Burgess in rotational roles as rookies and full-blown starters soon thereafter.",

They brought back Andrus Peat, but Ruiz gives them another player who can start on the interior of the offensive line immediately. He was a center at Michigan but played a few games at guard and should easily slide over to one of the guard spots if necessary. Zack Baun saw a sharp drop from his No. 32 ranking on Matt Miller's big board. Some of that is likely because he's a tweener. He was primarily used as a rush linebacker off the edge at Wisconsin, but Saints head coach Sean Payton believes Baun can play both the \"Mike\" and \"Sam\" in New Orleans. It takes some projection to envision how his game translates to the NFL, so his draft spot might make more sense than his predraft perception as a first-round talent. The Saints paid a hefty price to move up and get Baun. They sent the 88th pick and a 2021 third-round selection to Cleveland for him. Then they traded up again to get one of the best tight ends in a shallow class of them in Adam Trautman. His blocking should allow him to make a quicker contribution than most rookie tight ends.",

The Giants went to the offensive line well once again in Round 3 with Matt Peart. Taking a shot on a developmental tackle such as Peart is always good, because even if he doesn't pan out on the outside, there's a good chance he can still provide value as a guard down the line.

He's raw but has all the physical tools to become a legitimate threat for quarterback Sam Darnold. Ashtyn Davis and Jabari Zuniga continued the trend of athleticism over everything for the Jets.

Jalen Hurts was the biggest surprise pick of the draft because it's hard to even come up with a precedent. Hurts was a productive quarterback at Oklahoma and Alabama, but taking him in the second round with Carson Wentz on the roster doesn't make much sense at first (or even second glance). If the Eagles are just planning on his being a backup, it makes no sense. If they are planning on utilizing him in an enlarged Taysom Hill role, it's hard to grade because we've never seen a team try to make a second quarterback a part of its every-week scheming. Linebacker and offensive line might have been better needs to address with that pick, which they did in later rounds. Davion Taylor has the athleticism to be a good coverage linebacker but needs to develop his run-stuffing skills, which is better than having good skills in the run game and needing to develop the ability to cover. K'Von Wallace, John Hightower and Prince Tega Wanogho are as good a trio as a team could hope for on Day 3. Wallace can play in the slot.

The only person not worried about the QB depth seems to be Belichick, and he's good at coaching. So transitively, we're not worried. Uche could be the sneaky star here, and both tight ends were massively underused in their teams' inconsistent passing games, so there might be untapped receiving reserves.

Gibson, an all-purpose threat out of Memphis, may remind coach Ron Rivera of a mid-round version of his former player with the Panthers, Christian McCaffrey. The team lacked leverage in their stand-off with Pro Bowl left tackle Trent Williams, and thus will have to settle for the 2020 fifth-rounder (Ismael at No. 156 overall) and 2021 third-rounder they received from the 49ers. They selected Charles to fill Williams' big shoes -- and he has the potential to do so based on his athleticism. But he'll have to prevent the disciplinary issues that plagued him at LSU from following him to the NFL. Gandy-Golden's big body could be a problem for NFL cornerbacks down the field. Ismael, who could play guard or center for Washington, is a solid pick who will play for a long time. Hudson will provide depth in the secondary or at linebacker and should be a special teams demon. Edge rusher Smith-Williams could have been picked much earlier, so he's a relative bargain in the seventh round.",
