If Kincaid develops into the Kelce of this offense, then this pick will be a coup. Even if he ends up more like a Zach Ertz, that would be a great selection for quarterback Josh Allen, who desperately needed another reliable pass-catcher. The draft continued to Day 2 on a positive note with guard Cyrus O'Torrence, a mauler of incredible size (6-foot-5, 330 pounds), in the second round. Then things went against the grain in the third round when they took linebacker Dorian Williams. It made plenty of sense – until Bills GM Brandon Beane revealed he planned to use Williams as a weakside linebacker, rather than inside where they need help replacing Tremaine Edumunds. That made the pick a headscratcher. On Day 3, the Bills finished with fifth-round receiver Justin Shorter, who is actually bigger than most receivers in this draft at 6-foot-4 and 230 pounds.

Tight end Luke Schoonmaker has more potential than he's getting credit for, and running back Deuce Vaughn is a fun addition late on Day 3.

Trading up for Levis, despite his inconsistency, was not outrageous given that Ryan Tannehill's contract is scheduled to void after the 2023 season, per Over the Cap. I expect Spears to be a valuable contributor, despite his lack of an ACL.\n\nThe Titans parted with fourth- and sixth-round picks for receivers Julio Jones and Robert Woods in trades from previous years. Whyle was a good find in the fifth, though, as a potential threat in the red zone and intermediate passing game. The team hopes Duncan can use his athleticism more consistently as he matures.",

The Falcons' second-round pick, Syracuse offensive lineman Matthew Bergeron, brings smashmouth style in the run game that should be a boost to Atlanta's run game as well.

I am lower on the team's second-round pick, center Joe Tippman, than most, and thought he struggled to play with leverage at times and fell off too many blocks. I did like the team's fifth-round selection, running back Israel Abanikanda, who offers breakaway speed as a complement to Breece Hall. And Zack Kuntz is a great seventh-round flier, offering rare speed and explosiveness at the tight end position.",

I loved what Philly did basically from start to finish, and after grabbing both Jalen Carter and Nolan Smith in Round 1, they cleaned up the rest of the way: The Eagles added a solid tackle/guard prospect in Alabama's Tyler Steen and a hard-hitting safety in Illinois's Sydney Brown on day two, before taking yet another Georgia star in cornerback Kelee Ringo to open day three. Add in the trade with Detroit for running back D'Andre Swift (yes, he also went to Georgia) on Saturday, and the defending NFC champs look like one of the biggest winners of draft weekend.",

I loved this team's haul in Omar Khan's first draft as general manager, starting off with first-round tackle Broderick Jones and continuing through day three. Former Penn State cornerback Joey Porter Jr. was a steal (and a heartwarming story) with the first pick of day two, and I really like the pick of Wisconsin defensive tackle Keeanu Benton later that round. Each of those first three picks could be starters in Week 1. Georgia tight end Darnell Washington reportedly dropped in the draft because of concerns around the health of his knee, but if healthy, he projects as a perfect complement to Pat Freiermuth—and gives Pittsburgh more blocking power in the run game and on screen passes. Wisconsin linebacker Nick Herbig is an undersized but explosive pass rusher and Cory Trice is an excellent depth addition at corner.",

Seattle then did that thing they tend to do and took a probably-too-early running back in Zach Charbonnet in the second round, but overall, the rest of their class filled out nicely. They added a high-intensity edge rusher in Auburn's Derick Hall, potential future starters on the interior offensive line in LSU's Anthony Bradford and Michigan's Olusegun Oluwatimi, and grabbed rotational interior defensive linemen in Mississippi State's Cameron Young and Michigan's Mike Morris. They picked Georgia running back Kenny McIntosh in the seventh round for good measure, filling out their running back room with a quality pass-catcher out of the backfield. All in all this looks like a group of players who should see the field for Seattle sooner than later.",

But San Francisco ended up picking nine players; my favorite was the third-round selection of Penn State safety Ji'Ayir Brown. The former Nittany Lions star is a rangy, hard-hitting playmaker with excellent instincts—and he gives the 49ers some excellent depth behind Talanoa Hufanga and Tashaun Gipson. The rest of GM John Lynch's draft class lacked star power, though—and included a third-round kicker—so it's tough to give the Niners a big grade this year.",

Mauch gives the team a versatile and tough future starter. And I loved the selection of Louisville pass-rusher YaYa Diaby, who has the versatility to line up across the defensive line. Fifth-round tight end Payne Durham (Purdue) and sixth-round receiver Trey Palmer (Nebraska) should see rotational snaps early on, too. All in all, Tampa Bay put together a solid draft class.",

Levis has the tools and toughness to develop into a quality starter, and now he won't face the same pressure to start right away he would have felt if he had been a first rounder—and that could be a silver lining to his unexpected fall. Additionally, Tennessee was able to land a high-level pass protector in the first round instead, which could give Levis better support down the line. All in all, that series of events looks like a pretty positive outcome for a Tennessee team at a pivot point in 2023. I am also a fan of the team's third-round running back pick, Tyjae Spears, who adds a lightning element to Derrick Henry's thunder.",

So it's probably no surprise that the team's draft felt a little bit rudderless, too: In the first round, Washington took a playmaking corner in Mississippi State's Emmanuel Forbes, who brings takeaway-creating instincts but an outlier lack of bulk (he's just 166 pounds). I'm a fan of second-rounder Jartavius \"Quan\" Martin, who has the versatility to play both the safety and nickelback spots.
