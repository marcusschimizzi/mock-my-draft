They were able to acquire Josh Allen for the cost of tackle Cordy Glenn, two second-round picks and the No. 7 overall pick. Passing up Josh Rosen, a much more natural passer and safer choice than Allen, looks like the wrong decision at the moment. The rest of the Bills class looks strong. Linebacker Tremaine Edmunds will be head coach Sean McDermott's version of Shaq Thompson, and defensive tackle Harrison Phillips should earn rotational pass-rushing snaps early in his career. Day 3 defensive backs Taron Johnson and Siran Neal are athletic-upside picks and have the luxury of developing behind quality starters already in place. The late-round offensive picks are notable as well. Guard Wyatt Teller may earn a starting job with Richie Incognito retired, and receiver Austin Proehl should challenge for immediate playing time as a slot specialist. Their grade would've been higher had they landed Rosen instead of such a volatile prospect in Allen, but the rest of their class was impressive.",

Safety Minkah Fitzpatrick was a steal at No. 11 and will fit perfectly next to Reshad Jones. Third-round pick Jerome Baker was viewed as a potential first-rounder after his breakout 2016 season, but an up-and-down junior campaign in 2017 caused him to fall. Miami will need to simplify his role as an outside linebacker to ensure he's effective in pass coverage. Second-round pick Mike Gesicki is a massive upgrade for the Dolphins. Quarterback Ryan Tannehill hasn't had a reliable target since Charles Clay departed, and Gesicki is a higher-upside player with his ability to win contested catches. Fourth-round running back Kalen Ballage should also contribute as a pass-catcher early on, as he'll fill Damien Williams' role as a versatile movable piece. It's highly questionable as to whether the Dolphins should've addressed their backup quarterback situation instead of taking blocking tight end Durham Smythe in the fourth round. Although the athletic profiles of both Cornell Armstrong and Quentin Poling are promising, the Dolphins offensive line desperately needed depth.",

He must lower his turnover-worthy plays, but he was worthy of being picked so high because of the potential payoff. The Jets also found great value on the defensive side of the ball.

Day 2 defenders Jessie Bates, Sam Hubbard and Malik Jefferson are all solid athletes who can assume at least rotational roles this season.

Hubbard is the heir apparent to strong-side end Carlos Dunlap because of his size and run-stuffing ability. Jefferson is especially intriguing as a Vontaze Burfict replacement, although he's always been more of a raw athlete playing the position as opposed to a finished product. The Bengals may not get much out of their Day 3 picks for a few years, but they've excelled at bringing along developmental players to start in the future.

The former Heisman Trophy winner was terrific at Oklahoma, but he'll have to improve playing within structure and in the pocket before he'll be a great NFL quarterback. If the Browns took anything other than what will be one of the best two quarterbacks from this class, it'll be viewed as a failure again. Taking cornerback Denzel Ward at No. 4 over Bradley Chubb was questionable despite needs at both positions. A third pass-rusher in their rotation would've built a line in the same manner as the Philadelphia Eagles. Nevada offensive lineman Austin Corbett may have been a third consecutive reach at No. 33, as it's unknown whether he can play tackle or if he'll back up their expensive interior linemen for a few years. Day 3 picks Antonio Callaway and Genard Avery are high-upside players worth their respective risks.

Quarterback Ben Roethlisberger wanting to play three more years makes the Rudolph pick highly questionable. Passing on Iowa cornerback Josh Jackson, UCF cornerback Mike Hughes or even an edge-rusher like Boston College's Harold Landry will loom large if Edmunds doesn't drastically improve on his 2017 tape.

Former Ohio State defensive lineman Tyquan Lewis is more of a sure thing, as he was a quality starter on a loaded defense for several years.

The team traded up twice to get questionable values in running back Kerryon Johnson and defensive end Da'Shawn Hand. Losing a 2019 third-round pick for Hand is a heavy price, and they moved a fourth-rounder to jump eight spots for Johnson. First-round center Frank Ragnow is a stud, though, and they did well to bolster the line again with Oregon's Tyrell Crosby. Crosby surprisingly fell but will bring versatility to play either tackle or move inside to guard. It's amazing how the Lions have rebuilt the offensive line to be a real strength after being toward the bottom of the league only a few years ago. The reach on Tracy Walker and poor trade values for their other picks limits their grade, however. The team still needs a pass-rusher and linebacker corps improvements.",

Defensive coordinator Mike Pettine also has the athletic Oren Burks to work with now, and he should be a considerable upgrade on Jake Ryan as a middle linebacker. Nabbing defensive tackle James Looney was also a good steal as a developmental piece. The offense wasn't neglected, as Green Bay added two explosive receivers in J'Mon Moore and Equanimeous St. Brown. The latter fell inexplicably and could be one of the biggest steals of the draft.

Passing up on help at guard for Hughes is debatable, though, and the Vikings doubled down by selecting developmental tackle Brian O'Neill in the second round. They'll enter the year with an unsettled guard position in front of new quarterback Kirk Cousins. Sixth-round pick Colby Gossett will be expected to compete for a starting job unless a veteran is signed.

Davenport tested incredibly well at the combine and will need to realize his potential within the next four years to pay off the investment the Saints made. Quarterback Drew Brees will love having Tre'Quan Smith as his newest receiver, though. Smith is a big, fast and vertically explosive player who can separate with ease on crossing routes. He'll quickly upgrade the receiver corps. Day 3 brought a mixed bag of backups and developmental fliers. The most notable was Boston College defensive back Kamrin Moore, who is a potential slot safety in the NFL, and the Saints have favored that role over the last two seasons.

Their next three picks, Christian Kirk, Mason Cole and Chase Edmonds, will help the offense now and after Rosen eventually takes the reins.

Giving up two second-round picks without trading the No. 22 pick this year or next year's first-round pick is fine. Allen's inaccuracy as a thrower against marginal competition makes him a risk that many teams wouldn't want to take. He showed improvement through the draft process, though, so it's possible this will turn out. The Bills also moved down in last year's draft to get a second first-rounder this year via Kansas City, and then moved back up when the exceptional Edmunds was available at 16. A good trade, especially since they only moved from the third to the fifth round in the deal. Trading to land Allen made Friday night quiet for the Bills, and we'll have to see if he was worth it. But picking up Phillips late in the third round was a great deal, as he could be a perfect replacement for nose tackle Kyle Williams whenever he retires. The guy led Stanford in tackles last year as a nose tackle. Think about that. Buffalo was looking for interior O-line depth coming into the draft, and found a future starter in Teller, one of the strongest players in the draft. Their secondary needed bodies, as well, and two small-school players (Johnson and Neal) will more than just fill roster spots. McCloud and Proehl provide very good depth as inside receivers.",

With Julius Thomas no longer on the team, the Dolphins needed to find a tight end. Gesicki is a phenomenal athlete, like Thomas, but scouts were concerned about his long strides preventing him from winning against veteran defenders. He'll be tough to defend against on jump balls, though. Miami needed a linebacker, and Baker can move. They met their top defensive need with that pick. Miami got another tight end in the fourth round, landing a solid blocker/receiver in Smythe. Ballage was a steal in the fourth round, as well, for a team that needed a good, young player at the position behind Frank Gore.

I think fellow tight end Dallas Goedert has a potentially great future, though, so I would have gone that direction instead. Giving up a second-round pick in 2019 to get Jackson is not an overly risky play. I'm a believer in Jackson's playmaking ability and he's under no pressure to play in 2018. Jackson is a worthy selection. Brown was a strong legacy pick for the Ravens. The son of the late former Ravens OT Orlando Brown will likely outperform his much-maligned workout numbers at left or right tackle, especially if he shows teams those poor results were not because of a problem with his work ethic. Andrews joined Hurst as tight ends picked in this draft by the Ravens. Andrews will test the middle of defenses much like Hurst. Joe Flacco and Jackson will love throwing to these guys. Newsome grabbed Averett, a feisty corner, in the fourth round. He also picked a coverage linebacker in Young and a big, agile receiver in Scott. Lasley has immaturity red flags, but a fair amount of talent as a downfield threat.

The Bengals could have waited and landed a very good interior offensive lineman in the second or third round. The Bengals picked up an extra third-round pick by moving down a few spots in Round 2. Their back-to-back third-rounders -- Hubbard and Jefferson -- beef up their front seven. The games of both guys weren't loved by scouts, but in the third round, these picks make sense. Jefferson could be a particularly good value if everything comes together as he matures. Walton is a well-rounded offensive weapon, presenting good value in the fourth round. I've been a fan of Harris since the fall. I suspect he'll be a very good reserve corner in time. Brown met a need to improve the depth on the defensive line, and could be a steal if he consistently applies his quickness and strength.

Now, they have Mayfield, a fiery leader with passing skills that they believe can take the team's mojo to the next level. They had to pick a QB at No. 1, and they did. The only red flag here is that Mayfield needs to make plays from the pocket to succeed. If Sam Darnold or Josh Rosen excel and Mayfield doesn't, then their process was flawed. Picking Ward No. 4 overall, ahead of Bradley Chubb, was a bit of a reach. If he ends up being a Terence Newman clone, though, it could turn out to be a good pick. On Day 2, the Browns used a pick they received in Brock Osweiler trade to solidify their offensive line with Corbett, who can play inside or outside. Will he replace Joe Thomas? Chubb was an excellent choice, as well, because he will pound the ball between the tackles and create space for himself. Thomas is an athletic, explosive defensive end who can make an impact as a rotational player right away. Keep in mind that the Browns also used a third-round pick to get a solid veteran starter in Tyrod Taylor, who will be a bridge to Mayfield. One of the Browns' fourth-round picks went to Miami for receiver Jarvis Landry. Then they traded up in Round 4 to select another receiver in Callaway, who had many off-field issues but could be a steal down the road if he can stay out of trouble. Avery would have been a top-75 pick without a knee injury, so Dorsey stole a future starter in the fifth round.

Washington isn't tall or an elite speedster, but his super-long arms and ability to win the jump ball make him a solid find late in the second round. He was paired with his former teammate, Rudolph, in the third round. They could make for an interesting duo in a couple of years. Rudolph was a good third-round value. Okorafor could become a starter, but needs to work harder and faster on the field or he'll be out of the league fast. Allen adds another tough-minded safety to the Steelers' defensive back trove, though I believe he could be used in a linebacker-type role to take advantage of his toughness and agility.

Will Texas' Malik Jefferson or Georgia's Lorenzo Carter -- who were both still on the board -- prove to be better players? Time will tell. They found their nose tackle in the third round, picking Jones. This might have been a little early for him, but we'll see if he can put it all together to be more than a rotational player. White is a physical player with ball skills. Even after signing Mike Pouncey, the Chargers picked Quessenberry, a sturdy pivot who will start in the future. They did not find any depth at guard or tackle, though, nor a quarterback to compete with Geno Smith and Cardale Jones for a backup spot.",

Hall was one of my favorite non-FBS players in this draft, but his ascension to the second round was astounding. I believe his quickness and tenacious nature will translate to the NFL. Parker is raw and a bit of a reach in the early third, especially for a team that already picked an offensive tackle in Round 1. The Raiders took a chance on Key, who struggled with issues and injuries during his college career. If he can straighten things out, maybe he'll use his length to become a potent pass rusher. The Raiders traded for a couple veteran receivers -- Martavis Bryant and Ryan Switzer -- over the course of the draft. Ateman is another pass catcher who could make the team with his strong hands and physicality. Nelson adds much-needed competition to the team's cornerback group.

Moving up for Burks cost them a fourth-rounder, but he adds athleticism, strength, versatility and intelligence. He'll be a good starter for them at a spot they desperately needed to upgrade. Green Bay went with Moore, Valdes-Scantling, and St. Brown at receiver to re-build that position. All of those guys could make a case for a roster spot. Madison could be a long-time starter at guard.
