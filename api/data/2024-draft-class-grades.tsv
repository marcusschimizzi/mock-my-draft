class	fox-sports	ari	a	Cardinals GM Monti Ossenfort lived up to his reputation as a wheeler and dealer. Since taking over in 2023, Ossenfort has brokered 11 trades, including six on draft day and a pair on draft day this year. Ossenfort's moves helped Arizona secure a handful of impact players, led by the best receiver in this year's draft in Ohio State's Marvin Harrison Jr. Arizona drafted much-needed pass rush help in Missouri defensive lineman Darius Robinson and Clemson's Xavier Thomas. The Cardinals also added an explosive running back in Florida State's Trey Benson and two cover corners in Rutgers' Max Melton and Boston College's Elijah Jones. The 12 picks by Arizona are the most in a single draft by the team since 1992. —Eric D. Williams
class	fox-sports	atl	c-	Taking quarterback Michael Penix Jr. at No. 8 — after giving Kirk Cousins $100 million guaranteed last month — was easily the most criticized pick of the draft. Giving up a third-round pick to slide up eight spots for DT Ruke Orhorhoro in the second round felt like a reach, though Atlanta made a concerted push to upgrade its defensive front, using five of eight picks there. If Penix finds success in the next two years, it's at the expense of a huge investment in Cousins, and the class as a whole feels underwhelming. —Greg Auman
class	fox-sports	bal	b	To be fair, the Ravens' patience doesn't always pay off — but damn if it isn't impressive anyway. Given their holes on the offensive line, it was interesting when they opted for cornerback Nate Wiggins in the first round. Not to worry; they hung out at the back of the second round and got a starter-caliber tackle in Roger Rosengarten, anyway. Adding deep threat receiver Devontez Walker in the fourth round feels like a sneaky good value, too — which would be a fun development for Lamar Jackson. It's worth noting that Baltimore has yet to find a star edge rusher, but those guys are tough to find when you're consistently picking late. —David Helman
class	fox-sports	buf	b-	Bills GM Brandon Beane might draft for need as much — or more than — any other executive in the NFL. This draft is a perfect example of that. And he addressed those needs in order of priority: receiver (Keon Coleman), safety (Cole Bishop), defensive tackle (DeWayne Carter), running back (Ray Davis) and interior offensive line (Sedrick Van Pran-Granger). I get leery about GMs drafting for need, because it often means they've reached. There's some of that here. But for the most part, there's more to like about this draft. Buffalo's moves back out of the first round allowed Beane to target what he seemed to think was the sweet spot. —Henry McKenna
class	fox-sports	car	b-	Give the Panthers credit for being ambitious, sliding up a spot for WR Xavier Legette, giving up two fifths to get the draft's top running back in Jonathon Brooks in the second. I expected a pass-rusher, and more splash on defense. Tight end Ja'Tavion Sanders felt like good value in a weak class for the position. Even without the No. 1 pick, you expect more impact from a draft after the worst record in the NFL. —Auman
class	fox-sports	chi	a-	The Bears had as good of a draft as they could possibly hope for. They got their quarterback of the future in Caleb Williams and a potential star receiver in Rome Odunze, instantly making him one of, if not the best, No. 3 WR in the league. Chicago's offense now boasts Odunze with veterans DJ Moore and Keenan Allen, as well as D'Andre Swift, Cole Kmet, Gerald Everett and Williams at the helm. On paper, the Bears look to be one of the most complete teams in the league, especially after grabbing a punter with their last original pick. That was a weird gamble, even if Tory Taylor was the best punter in college football last year at Iowa.   Chicago also finally addressed edge by trading back into the draft in the fifth round to take Austin Booker out of Kansas. I don't think he's the unquestioned answer opposite Montez Sweat but can add to the rotation. The confusing priorities at the end of the draft tack on a minus to what is otherwise a near-perfect draft in the Windy City. —Carmen Vitali
class	fox-sports	cin	a	I love the way Cincinnati drafted ahead of time here. They signed Trent Brown for the short term at tackle, but Amarius Mims will hopefully anchor that line for years to come. They brought in Sheldon Rankins in free agency, but they'll be hoping Kris Jenkins and McKinnley Jackson are the future of the defensive front. They still have Tee Higgins on the roster, but Jermaine Burton is an immediate option and could be a long-term replacement. This is how good teams stay on top: planning for the future. —Helman 
class	fox-sports	cle	c	On the downside, the Browns had no first-round pick and just two selections in the top 100, so it was going to be hard to improve the roster. On the bright side, they have a quality roster and are getting starting quarterback Deshaun Watson back from injury, so they don't need a ton. I think Michael Hall and Zak Zinter are good players who bolster the offensive and defensive lines, but that doesn't move the needle much for 2024. This is a vet-heavy team that won't lean much on rookies, from the looks of it. —Helman
class	fox-sports	dal	b	For a team that had so many holes to fill after they did nothing in free agency, the Cowboys made some curious choices. They did a great job plugging two key holes on the O-line (Oklahoma LT Tyler Guyton in Round 1 and Kansas State C Cooper Beebe in Round 2). But no running back? No receiver until Round 6? Instead, in Round 2, they took Western Michigan edge rusher Marshawn Kneeland, who could be terrific in 2025, but might not be a huge help now, when they're supposedly "all-in." Notre Dame LB Marist Liufau felt like a big reach in the third at another position where they needed help. —Vacchiano 
class	fox-sports	den	b-	Denver’s draft is largely a referendum on quarterback Bo Nix, the sixth passer picked in the first 12 slots of the draft. Throwing for 45 touchdowns against three interceptions as a senior at Oregon is impressive, and Denver got his top receiver by taking Troy Franklin in the fourth round. Denver and Sean Payton will have much of their success pinned to how Nix performs. —Auman
class	fox-sports	det	b+	I had wondered if the Lions' draft strategy would change given they had limited needs coming into this weekend. It did, as general manager Brad Holmes pulled off four trades across all three days to get picks for positions of need, using one for cornerback Terrion Arnold out of Alabama at No. 24 overall. Their next pick was also a corner in Missouri's Ennis Rakestraw. Tell me where they saw a need for improvement without telling me. They started Day 3 with a bang by trading a future third to get an international player in tackle Giovanni Manu in the fourth round. I'm not a huge fan of giving up richer future capital, but Holmes has earned the benefit of the doubt. I appreciate that Holmes again got his guys, consensus big board be damned. The Lions also by far and away won the award for best war-room attire. —Vitali
class	fox-sports	gb	b	The Packers entered the 2024 NFL Draft with 11 picks … and ended up making 11 while maneuvering up and down. Jordan Morgan should fit right in on their position-fluid offensive line. Linebacker Edgerrin Cooper can be an excellent complement to Quay Walker. Now that Jeff Hafley is the defensive coordinator, the Packers needed to stock up on his favorite position: safety. They got Xavier McKinney in a splash free agency signing but still drafted three more players at the position. Javon Bullard out of Georgia at No. 58 overall is excellent value. The other big splash was USC running back MarShawn Lloyd, who will go up against his college quarterback twice a year now. Throw in a couple of additional offensive linemen for depth/competition and you have a perfectly solid Green Bay draft. GM Brian Gutekunst is notorious for getting production out of later round picks and this year figures to be no different. —Vitali
class	fox-sports	hou	a-	Texans general manager Nick Caserio set the tone for this draft class by saying that it would be difficult for a rookie to make a significant impact on the 2024 team. That indicated a desire to look for depth and to the future, and Houston definitely achieved that objective at a number of positions: corner, offensive tackle, safety and tight end among them. Second-round pick Kamari Lassiter, one of the top corners in college football last season, should still have a chance to start in Year 1 alongside Derek Stingley. —Ben Arthur
class	fox-sports	ind	c+	Four of the Colts' first five picks addressed the offense. They've done everything they can to make quarterback Anthony Richardson, returning this season after an abbreviated rookie year, as comfortable as possible — and you can't blame them. Receiver Adonai Mitchell represented great value late in the second round. With that being said, Indianapolis could have used a cornerback high. The team has some uncertainty at the spot, which is especially important in the receiver-loaded AFC South. That represents a gamble for Indy. —Arthur 
class	fox-sports	jax	a-	Only time will tell, but the Jaguars had a great draft on paper. They were able to trade down in the first round from 17 to 23 to get Brian Thomas Jr., whom general manager Trent Baalke said would've been the pick at 17. He had been valued by many as a mid-first-round pick. Fourth-rounder Javon Foster, a standout offensive tackle in the SEC, could immediately step in as the No. 3 OT with a chance to be a starter in the future. Jacksonville also leaves the draft with tremendous depth and on the defensive line behind standout trio Josh Allen, Travon Walker and Arik Armstead. —Arthur 
class	fox-sports	kc	a-	Boasting an elite defense, the reigning Super Bowl champion Chiefs entered this draft season needing to get more help for Patrick Mahomes on the offensive side of the ball, especially in the wake of Rashee Rice's legal troubles. They did so in a big way (and Mahomes showed his gratitude to general manager Brett Veach on social media). They added a weapon in Xavier Worthy whose 4.21-second 40-yard dash set an NFL Combine record. That speed figures to be lethal with Mahomes. Kansas City's top three picks were on offense. —Arthur 
class	fox-sports	lv	b-	Brock Bowers was far and away the draft’s best tight end, and second-rounder Jackson Powers-Johnson can be an immediate starter on the interior offensive line. The Raiders didn’t take a QB, but small-school running back Dylan Laube could be a steal. —Auman
class	fox-sports	lac	a-	New Chargers coach Jim Harbaugh focused on bringing in prospects from Power 5 conferences who played at big-time, winning programs. The centerpiece of the group is Notre Dame offensive tackle Joe Alt, who will play right tackle with Pro Bowler Rashawn Slater staying at left tackle. Second-rounder Ladd McConkey has a chance to take over the lion's share of the targets lost by the departure of Keenan Allen. Third-round selection Junior Colson has experience calling Chargers defensive coordinator Jesse Minter's defense at Michigan. Harbaugh also added picks with famous family ties. Day 3 selection Troy running back Kimani Vidal's great uncle is Hank Aaron. And Hall of Famer Jerry Rice's son Brenden Rice was taken in the seventh round. —Williams
class	fox-sports	lar	b	Sean McVay prepared for life without Aaron Donald by selecting five defensive players, including four who can play along the front seven to generate a pass rush. The Rams selected in the first round for the first time since taking Jared Goff No. 1 overall in 2016, grabbing powerful edge rusher Jared Verse at No. 19. They followed that by taking Verse's teammate at Florida State in the second round in defensive tackle Braden Fiske. Michigan RB Blake Corum gives L.A. a similar runner to spell Pro Bowler Kyren Williams. And Stanford product Josh Karty being selected in the sixth round is L.A.'s latest attempt to solve this team's kicking woes. Overall, the Rams put together a solid class to follow up a very productive group from last year. —Williams 
class	fox-sports	mia	a-	You had to laugh when the Dolphins took Jaylen Wright, the draft's second-fastest running back. Last year, they took Devon Achane, one of the fastest players in the NFL. But that didn't stop them from bringing more speed into the offense in the fourth round. Wright followed a good get in the first round in Chop Robinson, an edge rusher who'll help the team manage snaps for Jaelan Phillips and Bradley Chubb, who both ended last year with major injuries. They also managed to snap up a tackle in Patrick Paul, who will develop behind Terron Armstead. It was a great draft, one that matched value with need. —McKenna 
class	fox-sports	min	a	The Vikings needed a quarterback and got one. Though he likely wasn't their first choice (they reportedly tried to trade up to No. 3 presumably to select Drake Maye), this may have ended up being the ideal scenario. They needed to trade up just one spot from their first pick at No. 11 to select Michigan quarterback J.J. McCarthy.  GM Kwesi Adofo-Mensah was still aggressive with the No. 23 pick, trading up to No. 17 to get Alabama edge Dallas Turner, widely considered one of the best defenders in the draft. Both are arguably top-10 prospects. The drawback is that the Vikings are now extremely low on draft capital next year. They have their first-round pick and just two fifth-round picks. They should expect at least one if not two third-round compensatory picks for losing Kirk Cousins and Danielle Hunter to free agency, but their roster is in solid shape, especially after adding another corner in Khyree Jackson from Oregon and multiple offensive linemen for depth. The Vikings almost certainly won the first round, but they may win the entire draft if McCarthy pans out. —Vitali   
class	fox-sports	ne	b+	Drake Maye didn't have the support he needed when the Patriots took him third overall. And a prospect like Maye — who is high risk, high reward — will need plenty of support to reach his potential. So it's worth crediting executive Eliot Wolf for spending the next four picks (a second, third and two fourths) on offensive players. New England added receivers Ja'Lynn Polk and Javon Baker. The Patriots even doubled up at QB with Joe Milton (Tennessee), another prospect with an incredible arm (albeit with rough accuracy and touch). It's clear the Patriots wanted to prioritize their offense, and it feels like the board lined up with their needs. —McKenna 
class	fox-sports	no	b	The Saints made two strong picks at the top of the class, addressing a glaring need with tackle Taliese Fuaga and moving up to get corner Kool-Aid McKinstry, seen by many as a potential first-round pick. Hit on your first two picks, it's a good draft, but there's not a ton more to this. Spencer Rattler isn't a bad pick, but they used a 2024 fourth to get Jake Haener last year, so will both make the 53 alongside starter Derek Carr? —Auman 
class	fox-sports	nyg	b+	The Giants wanted to trade up for a new franchise QB, but they couldn't do it. So instead they helped out their old one by taking LSU's Malik Nabers, the most explosive WR in the draft, sixth overall. That alone should re-energize their offense. They turned to their secondary on Day 2 and got one of the draft's best safeties in Minnesota's Tyler Nubin (Round 2), but were too late for the top corners when they took Kentucky's Andru Phillips in the third. Penn State TE Theo Johnson (Round 4) could be big for them if veteran Darren Waller retires. —Vacchiano 
class	fox-sports	nyj	b	It was a tough draw that Rome Odunze went at No. 9 — though not unexpected. So the Jets traded down and still added Penn State tackle Olu Fashanu, which made plenty of sense. As good as Tyron Smith is when he's healthy, he's not healthy often. Fashanu will provide much-needed depth at tackle for Smith and Morgan Moses. Brock Bowers might have been tempting because he would instantly start — but I think they'll get more bang for their buck with Fashanu, especially considering how little Aaron Rodgers uses his tight ends. In Round 3, the Jets took a feisty WR in Malachi Corley. New York also added two running backs to their stable — which felt a little unnecessary, but I suppose they went with what the board gave them. —McKenna   
class	fox-sports	phi	a-	Eagles GM Howie Roseman is a wizard. After trying to trade up in the first round for a CB, the top one — Toledo's Quinyon Mitchell — fell right to him at 22. Then he got another corner with a first-round grade by trading up for Iowa's Cooper DeJean in Round 2. That alone would've made it a great weekend for Philly, but Roseman added to it with a Day 3 deal to bring LB Jeremiah Trotter Jr. to his father's old franchise. Their one curious move was taking Houston Christian edge rusher Jalyx Hunt in the third, but the Eagles can afford a high-ceiling project like that. Oh, and all of Roseman's trades got them some 2025 draft capital, too. —Vacchiano
class	fox-sports	pit	a+	If these picks hit, the Steelers' offensive line could be something special. Last year's first-round pick, Broderick Jones, is already showing promise. Pittsburgh has now added two likely starters in Troy Fautanu and Zach Frazier. Fautanu was seen by many as a top-10 prospect, and he fell to the Steelers at 20th overall. It was a similar story for Frazier, whom many rated as a top 40 guy, but fell to No. 51. Throw in fourth-round pick Mason McCormick, and things are looking as good as they have up front in a long time. If that wasn't good enough, the Steelers found themselves a versatile slot receiver in Roman Wilson, who should be ready to contribute right away. If he can stay healthy, it's also a good guess that Payton Wilson's high motor and toughness will make him a fan favorite in Pittsburgh. Those are just bonuses, though. If the Steelers have finally fixed their offensive line, this entire class will have been worth it. —Helman
class	fox-sports	sf	b-	The 49ers picked in the first round for the first time since moving up to take Trey Lance at No. 3 overall in the 2021 draft. Florida receiver Ricky Pearsall was somewhat of a surprise at No. 31, but he gives San Francisco another pass catcher who can operate in the slot and make plays over the middle of the field. The 49ers found a potential cover corner in the second round in Renardo Green and an explosive runner on Day 3 in Louisville's Isaac Guerendo. However, the 49ers needed offensive line help and didn't secure upgrades up front offensively until moving up in the third round to grab promising Kansas offensive lineman Dominick Puni, and later in Day 3 in USC offensive lineman Jarrett Kingston. San Francisco should have focused on this obvious need earlier in the draft. —Williams 
class	fox-sports	sea	b	First-round defensive tackle Byron Murphy is a home-run pick — one of the top defensive players in the draft who should develop into a mainstay on Seattle's defense for the next decade. But Seattle had just two picks in the top 100 because of the Leonard Williams trade, making it tough to secure impact players. Connecticut offensive lineman Christian Haynes should fight for time along the starting offensive line. UTEP linebacker Tyrice Knight is a tackling machine and Michigan's AJ Barner has a chance to earn a role as a blocking tight end. But it appears these late-round picks are more developmental prospects who could take a few years to find roles for Seattle. —Williams 
class	fox-sports	tb	b+	The Bucs made no trades but still pulled in a strong class that hit on key needs. Center Graham Barton leads the way, with edge Chris Braswell, nickel Tykee Smith and receiver Jalen McMillan all in the top 100 picks. There were no trades, no small-school gems to be found, but they brought in potential impact players all over the field. Tampa Bay had the same record as New Orleans, but picked 12 spots later in each round as a result of being division champ.  —Auman   
class	fox-sports	ten	b-	At the top of the draft, the Titans showed a commitment to physicality and owning the trenches with offensive-minded coach Brian Callahan. They've taken on some risk with that approach — they're moving JC Latham from right to left tackle, and nose tackle T'Vondre Sweat has some conditioning concerns — but if it pans out, Tennessee could be looked at as big winners two to three years now. Apart from safety and tight end, the Titans leave the draft having addressed every other need. —Arthur 
class	fox-sports	was	b+	Rule No. 1 of drafting a franchise QB: surround him with help. But that's not really what the Commanders did after drafting LSU QB Jayden Daniels second overall. They turned to their defense, where they did get great second-round value in Illinois DT Jer'Zhan Newton and Michigan CB Mike Sainristil. Both could be big-time players. The same goes for second-round TE Ben Sinnott. All their top picks were excellent, but their O-line is still a glaring issue and they didn't address that until Round 3 with TCU guard Brandon Coleman. That could turn out to be a regrettable decision. —Ralph Vacchiano 
class	yahoo-sports	dal	c+	This draft went about how most people expected. The Cowboys got a potential Tyron Smith replacement in the first round, added front seven help and got depth on the offensive line. This draft might not have huge immediate returns for the Cowboys, but they made some strong dice rolls on future starters. The team sits in limbo as Jerry Jones decides what he wants to do next with his franchise, making this an important draft for the Cowboys to nail. 
class	yahoo-sports	nyg	b+	The Giants wanted a quarterback, but they still came away with a solid group of players despite not taking one. Malik Nabers is the receiver they’ve needed for quite some time and they found a solid replacement for Xavier McKinney in Tyler Nubin. Theo Johnson is a smart draft pick in response to Darren Waller being unsure about his playing future. The Giants might not have been able to make the splash they wanted but they should feel good about where they stand. 
class	yahoo-sports	phi	a-	The Eagles played the draft so well. They let Quinyon Mitchell fall right into their lap with the 22nd overall pick and he has all the tools necessary to be a CB1 in the NFL. Then, they jumped back up in Round 2 to grab the falling Cooper DeJean. Taking swings on Ainias Smith and Johnny Wilson on the third day of the draft might work for them and they made the feel-good selection of Jeremiah Trotter Jr. They also added a couple picks in 2025, including a future third-round selection from the Dolphins. Well played, Howie Roseman. 
class	yahoo-sports	was	b	It’s a new day for the Commanders. They have a new franchise quarterback, a couple impact defenders and even a freak athlete on the offensive line to develop. The Jayden Daniels pick is risky based on his prospect profile, but he still should be a drastic upgrade over what they had in Sam Howell last season. This class hinges on Daniels being a top-tier starter, but they did grab some solid players in the draft. This draft class should make fans feel more hopeful after a shaky free agency period.
class	yahoo-sports	chi	a	You made it, Bears fans. A quarterback prospect who has real deal superstar upside is here. Caleb Williams has all the talent in the world to finally be the dynamic passer the Bears have been waiting for — and he is set up well for success. They drafted Rome Odunze with their second top-10 pick and a developmental tackle in the third round with Kiran Amegadjie. Even their fifth-round selection of Austin Booker was quality! This draft class can be so impactful that it gets an A even with picking a punter in the fourth round. 
class	yahoo-sports	det	b	Detroit made some great picks in the first two rounds of the draft and some risky ones to kick off Day 3. They accomplished their goal of getting better at cornerback this offseason, now featuring a completely revamped room as Terrion Arnold and Ennis Rakestraw Jr. will join Carlton Davis in Detroit. The Lions even got a couple sixth-rounders with potential to close out their day. It’s really just the selections in the fourth round that are giving a bit of pause here. 
class	yahoo-sports	gb	b	The Packers made a ton of draft picks and came out looking pretty good. Their linebacker picks were questionable (although the entire linebacker class was down this year), but they found a potential franchise left tackle in Jordan Morgan at the end of the first round. They took three safeties as well and might have a tough, versatile duo now between Javon Bullard and Xavier McKinney. MarShawn Lloyd is a quality addition at running back while they test Josh Jacobs for at least a season. 
class	yahoo-sports	min	c+	The Vikings went all in and got their quarterback and edge rusher of the future. Whew. As a result, they barely have any 2025 picks. They do have some talented prospects at key positions to build around. J.J. McCarthy and Dallas Turner can be solid NFL players, but the Vikings paid a high price to attain them. Right now, the only top-100 pick they’re slated to have in 2025 is their first-round pick (with at least one third-round compensatory pick coming their way for Kirk Cousins). This better work! 
class	yahoo-sports	atl	d-	Baffling. Pretty baffling use of the eighth overall pick. After signing Kirk Cousins, it was a bit of a shocker for the Falcons to use the pick on a backup quarterback rather than take someone who can play this year. Unless the Cousins signing is a total disaster, it will be years before the Falcons see Michael Penix Jr. on the field. This team is not ready for a resource allocation like that. The Falcons also failed to grab a cornerback in this draft, but they made some very solid picks along the defensive line that should help them finally stabilize that position group. The defensive line picks are the only thing keeping this from being an F grade.
class	yahoo-sports	car	c	The Panthers took some risks in this draft class. It’s hard to say whether it’s bad or good because making risky draft picks is not inherently a bad thing. Carolina decided to spend its picks taking home-run swings that have low floors and big upside. The gambles are fun, but the Panthers' early draft picks have shaky profiles in one way or another. Even though they’re getting a C, it’s hard not to be caught by the allure of the unknown here. It’s a really interesting class. 
class	yahoo-sports	no	b-	All those trades in the past left the Saints with only two picks in the top 100 of the draft and they went over 100 selections in between their own picks at one point. Still, the Saints grabbed an immediate starter at guard or tackle in Taliese Fuaga. He is another member of an extremely talented offensive line class that should have success in the NFL. The Saints grabbed a starting-caliber cornerback in Kool-Aid McKinstry and a developmental option at quarterback in Spencer Rattler. For as few draft assets as they came into the draft with, the Saints fared pretty well.
class	yahoo-sports	tb	b+	Really solid draft for the Buccaneers. Offensive lineman Graham Barton is one of the cleanest prospects in the draft and can play all five positions up front. This is a terrific player to pair with Tristan Wirfs. The Bucs also grabbed a solid wide receiver prospect in Jalen McMillan and a quality running back in Bucky Irving. How linebacker Chris Braswell and defensive back Tykee Smith develop will be important for the overall impact of this draft class. This is a nice haul for the Buccaneers. 
class	yahoo-sports	ari	b+	Shoutout to Arizona for not overthinking it. Grab the best player in the draft and keep it moving. They took some chances with the selections of Max Melton, Trey Benson and Xavier Thomas, giving them more credible prospects to continue this rebuild. The Cardinals might not win the division this season, but this draft class should help them get to competing for the playoffs soon, especially if Kyler Murray can build on his late-season resurgence. 
class	yahoo-sports	lar	b-	This was a safe, logical draft for the Rams, which makes sense for where they are now. They beefed up their defensive line, added a quality back and also a much-needed safety within the top 100 picks. There isn’t a lot of big upside here, but most of these players should have high floors for the NFL. It’s hard to see this draft class failing for the Rams, but they might not have true star power here.
class	yahoo-sports	sf	c-	Weird draft class for the 49ers, but it might not matter. They’ve turned a former "Mr. Irrelevant" into one of the most productive quarterbacks in the NFL. Ricky Pearsall was a surprise and head coach Kyle Shanahan made his patented mid-round running back pick. Yet it’s hard to look at a draft class that has Pearsall as a first-round selection and feel super great about it. Dominick Puni is a name to watch for them as a long-term developmental offensive guard. He’s has the movement skills Shanahan likes in his linemen.
class	yahoo-sports	sea	c+	Mixed feelings is the best way to describe the Seahawks' draft. They grabbed a potentially disruptive defensive lineman in Byron Murphy II — a piece they desperately needed. They also found someone who can compete for a starting role on the offensive line with Christian Haynes in the third round. Still, their Day 3 picks leave a bit to be desired, especially with no second-round pick this year due to the Leonard Williams trade.
class	yahoo-sports	buf	c+	The Bills played this draft safe and took home 10 players, although only one wide receiver in Keon Coleman. Even though Coleman didn’t have the cleanest end to his season and a slow 40-yard dash time at the scouting combine, he still has shown serious talent in college football. Coleman will start right away for the Bills and will immediately have a chance to prove whether he can separate from NFL cornerbacks. The Bills had another solid pickup in Ray Davis, but other than that this draft class was just fine. Probably not too many movers and shakers, but some quality players at positions of need. It will be interesting to see what happens with Travis Clayton, a developmental offensive line prospect from England.
class	yahoo-sports	mia	b+	It's a strong draft haul for the Dolphins. They found a potential 10-sack edge rusher with Chop Robinson in the first round and grabbed a future starter at offensive tackle with Patrick Paul. Their trade-up for Jaylen Wright in the fourth was perplexing. Overall this is still a good group of players. Malik Washington and Tahj Washington are two wide receivers who had a lot of buzz in college and could compete for reps behind Tyreek Hill and Jaylen Waddle.
class	yahoo-sports	ne	a-	New England had a tough decision to make on how it wanted to start its rebuild and it ultimately turned down a boatload of draft picks to stay at the top of the draft and pick Drake Maye. Maye has ridiculous upside and gives the Patriots a playmaking option while they fill out the rest of their roster. Ja’Lynn Polk and Javon Baker should compete for starting reps in one of the weaker wide receiver rooms in the league. Joe Milton III is an intriguing pick in the sixth round and it’ll at least be fun to track his development. If just one of their offensive line picks hit, this could be the foundation for a new run of excellence in New England.
class	yahoo-sports	nyj	b-	The Jets didn’t have a ton of draft capital to work with, but they still found some quality players, including a potential franchise tackle in Olu Fashanu from Penn State. He’ll be a fixture up front for a long, long time if the injury issues from last season don’t reappear. Wideout Malachi Corley will make fans happy early with his ability to run after the catch and Braelon Allen is a talented running back to develop behind Breece Hall. The trade up for QB Jordan Travis was baffling, but that was in the fifth round so no need to ding too much in the grand scheme of things.
class	yahoo-sports	bal	b+	Once again, the Ravens walked away with a strong draft class after letting players fall right into their laps. They started things off with Clemson cornerback Nate Wiggins and doubled back at the position with a potential huge steal by grabbing Iowa State cornerback T.J. Tampa in the fourth round. Tampa was projected to go much higher. The Ravens should also have a Day 1 starter at right tackle in Roger Rosengarten from Washington. They even found some quality depth they can develop on the edge with Penn State’s Adisa Isaac. The Ravens, as usual, didn’t overthink it and it looks like a great new crop of rookies.
class	yahoo-sports	cin	b+	The Bengals should be happy with how they played the first two days of the draft. Amarius Mims has the ability to be a decade-long starter at either tackle spot — if he can stay on the field. Kris Jenkins is a quality body on the defensive line and Jermaine Burton is an explosive playmaker who gives the Bengals flexibility at wide receiver. McKinnley Jackson might have been a reach to close the third round but the Bengals walked away with immediate impact and long-term potential at key spots.
class	yahoo-sports	cle	b	The Browns didn’t make their first pick until nearly the end of the second round, taking ultra-athletic defensive tackle Michael Hall Jr. from Ohio State. They added offensive line depth, picked a wide receiver and found some dart throws on defense in the sixth and seventh rounds. You can’t be too mad given the amount of capital they held walking into the draft.
class	yahoo-sports	pit	a	The Steelers looked at their offensive line from last year and emphatically said “never again!” Their two first draft picks were on the o-line and then they came back for a third time to kick off the fourth round. Payton Wilson has his concerns in terms of injury, but he was a great playmaker for NC State. Getting him with the 98th overall pick is a great spot for Pittsburgh. Quarterback will be the ultimate decider in how the Steelers' season turns out, but they may have found two impact starters on the offensive line in Troy Fautanu and Zach Frazier.
class	yahoo-sports	jax	c	The Jaguars' offseason has been just OK and the draft followed suit. They did a great job moving down from their original spot in Round 1 of the draft while still landing a big-time wide receiver prospect, which they needed after clumsily letting Calvin Ridley walk to a divisional rival in free agency. Beyond that, it doesn’t seem like they got too much positive impact, but if Thomas is the final key that allows the Jaguars’ passing game to be consistent in the future, it’s fine. Getting Trevor Lawrence another receiver was priority No. 1 and they might have gotten the best of the second wave of wide receivers.
class	yahoo-sports	hou	b	The Texans didn’t have a first-round pick, but they still grabbed a few quality players, including a starting nickel corner and developmental offensive tackle. Their first four picks have a chance to be immediate contributors, which is all you can ask for without a pick on the first day. It’s not the sexy draft that the Texans had last year when they nabbed C.J. Stroud and Will Anderson Jr., but it’s a draft that will help strengthen the team's foundation.
class	yahoo-sports	ten	c+	The Titans nailed their first pick, but could have done better the rest of the way. JC Latham is a “set it and forget it” type of offensive tackle who is already penciled in as a starter. It’ll be interesting to see how Latham handles being a left tackle in the NFL. He has enough talent to be successful. Getting Cedric Gray in the fourth round could be a long-term steal for the Titans, but overall it wasn’t a draft class to get excited about unless T’Vondre Sweat develops into a pass rusher.
class	yahoo-sports	ind	b+	This was a productive draft class for the Colts. They found the edge rusher they needed in Laiatu Latu and may have gotten a steal with the Adonai Mitchell pick in the second round. Depth along the offensive line was a need they filled as well and Anthony Gould in the fifth round may be a steal at wide receiver. If Anthony Richardson can stay healthy and build on what he accomplished as a rookie, the Colts might be able to actually get into the playoffs with the additions in this draft class.
class	yahoo-sports	den	d	Sorry, Broncos fans. There's no other way to slice this. The Broncos made some fantastic selections on the second and third days of the draft, but taking Bo Nix with the 12th overall pick is a head-scratcher. Nix wasn’t a prospect who was highly in demand and his ceiling appears limited in the NFL. Nix should win the starting job over Jarrett Stidham and Zach Wilson, but Nix will need to develop a level of playmaking that wasn’t really there on his college tape. Maybe head coach Sean Payton is right and he can make Nix the next Drew Brees, but that’s selling the peak of Brees’ play awfully short. It's a strange start for the Broncos as they kick off their rebuild. Outside of Nix, they may have found immediate, quality contributors with Utah edge rusher Jonah Elliss, Oregon WR Troy Franklin and Notre Dame RB Audric Estime. Franklin and Estime are younger prospects with legitimate upside.
class	yahoo-sports	kc	a	Hell of a draft for the back-to-back defending champs. They added elite, gamebreaking speed with their selection of Xavier Worthy in the first round and might have found a franchise left tackle in the second. Jared Wiley and Jaden Hicks were quality pickups in Round 4 and they took a couple dart throws on the offensive line later on. Wiley has the potential to be the Chiefs' starting tight end after Travis Kelce moves on, showing off rare movement ability for a 6-foot-6 player. Worthy, Kingsley Suamataia and Wiley may be cornerstones for the Chiefs’ offense when this is all said and done.
class	yahoo-sports	lv	b	The Raiders got a couple of impact players on offense, even if the fit isn’t immediately clear. Brock Bowers has superstar potential in the NFL. Figuring out how he’ll mesh with Michael Mayer and where their skills can be used simultaneously will be an interesting challenge for the Raiders’ coaching staff. Jackson Powers-Johnson should be a good fixture on the offensive line for the next few years and Delmar Glaze may wind up being a starter too. Solid first Raiders draft for general manager Tom Telesco and head coach Antonio Pierce. Now it’s time to figure out how the pieces fit together.
class	yahoo-sports	lac	b+	People might not like the Chargers taking an offensive tackle over a wide receiver with the fifth overall pick, but this is not a team that was a player away from getting to the top. They went 5-12 last season for a reason, mainly because they weren’t that good. The Chargers needed help everywhere, including offensive tackle, and got a franchise player in Joe Alt. He and Rashawn Slater will form a tremendously talented tackle duo to protect Justin Herbert and help head coach Jim Harbaugh get his offense off the ground in Los Angeles. They still grabbed an explosive wide receiver at the top of the second and a speedy linebacker from Michigan in the third round. The Chargers will need time to restock their roster with talent.
class	pro-football-network	ari	a	Not only did the Cardinals have a massive haul of 12 picks, but they also hit on most of their picks. MHJ and Darius Robinson are the biggest names, but Arizona refilled their talent pool and all their positions of need.
class	pro-football-network	atl	d	The egregious mistake of selecting quarterback Michael Penix Jr. at No. 8 overall after you signed Kirk Cousins to a four-year deal worth up to $180 million dollars is enough to garner an “F” grade alone. But trading up to reach on an interior defensive line prospect in the second round was the cherry on top of the disaster cake for the 2024 Atlanta Falcons draft experience.
class	pro-football-network	bal	a-	Say what you want about the Baltimore Ravens, but they consistently navigate the draft board very well over the years. Despite many linking the team to a wide receiver on Day 1, the team added Clemson CB Nate Wiggins on Day 1.  They then followed up that selection by finding a potential future replacement for Kevin Zeitler or John Simpson at guard with Roger Rosengarten in the second round.  Other exceptional value picks were Iowa State cornerback T.J. Tampa and Marshall running back Rasheen Ali in the fourth and fifth rounds, respectively.  
class	pro-football-network	buf	b+	The Buffalo Bills wrapped up their 2024 NFL Draft class on Saturday evening with an impressive haul of players at positions of need, with multiple impact makers safely squirreled away from training camp. Adding weapons for Josh Allen was always the priority, and the franchise landed Keon Coleman while making moves to acquire more capital.  With DeWayne Carter and Cole Bishop, the defensive spine was significantly strengthened, while Troy pass rusher Javon Solomon was a dangerous add in the fifth round. There weren’t too many reaches, they hit on plenty of needs and even provided intrigue by selecting British-born offensive tackle Travis Clayton to open the seventh round. Solid stuff. 
class	pro-football-network	car	b	The Dave Canales era in Carolina has started off with a solid first draft class headlined by South Carolina WR Xavier Legette and Texas RB Jonathon Brooks.  Both players may require a bit of patience from fans for both players to reach their potential, but both have an exceptionally high ceiling and should help Bryce Young in some capacity immediately. They could make this offense elite if they all reach their potential together. 
class	pro-football-network	chi	a+	The duo of Caleb Williams and Rome Odunze will define the Bears’ 2024 class. Williams has the potential to be truly special, and with Odunze, D.J. Moore, and Keenan Allen in his arsenal, he has everything he needs to reach his ceiling.  Everything after Williams and Odunze served as a bonus for the Bears, but they still managed to use their remaining picks to their advantage.  In Round 3, Amegadjie was a high-upside investment with starting potential at tackle and guard. Taylor fills a void at punter, and later, the Bears were proactive in trading back into the draft to acquire a dynamic EDGE in Booker.  Chicago’s roster was almost complete heading into the 2024 NFL Draft. Now, one could argue they’re ready to make noise in the upcoming season. 
class	pro-football-network	cin	b	The Bengals clearly prioritized addressing both the offensive and defensive line units heading into the 2024 NFL Draft and executed that strategy effectively by investing three of their first four picks in the trenches with Georgia OT Amarius Mims, Michigan DT Kris Jenkins, and Texas A&M DT McKinnley Jackson.  The best value pick of the draft may have been Alabama WR Jermaine Burton at No. 80 overall, who enters the league with some character issues but immense production upside with his explosive vertical skill set. 
class	pro-football-network	cle	b	The Browns prioritized adding talent along the interior of their defensive line with their top spick at No. 54 overall and selected Ohio State’s Michael Hall Jr. to join Dalvin Tomlinson and Shelby Harris in the defensive tackle rotation.  They also added Michigan guard Zak Zinter and Louisville wide receiver Jamari Thrash as potential future contributors in the middle rounds.  
class	pro-football-network	dal	b+	It might not have been the sexiest draft class of all time, but the Dallas Cowboys came away from the 2024 having built a very clear identity for the franchise going forward. Bullyball is coming to the Cowboys, with some big nasty beasts being selected on both sides of the ball.  Tyler Guyton has long-term left tackle potential, and Cooper Beebe is a beast on the interior, giving Dallas some flexibility as to how they construct their best five offensive linemen going forward.  Marist Liufau is a seek-and-destroy heavy-hitter from the linebacker position, and even wide receiver Ryan Flournoy has physicality as the hallmark of his game.  If you were looking to pick fault, you could argue that there were better nose tackle options available to complete the class in Round 7, but it was good work from a Cowboys front office who were feeling the heat following an offseason of relative inactivity. 
class	pro-football-network	den	b+	The vast majority of the Broncos 2024 class’ impact will be weighed based on Nix’s performance at QB. He is the tide that raises all boats — but value acquisitions like Franklin, Abrams-Draine, and Gargiulo can’t go overlooked.  With the little capital they had, the Broncos were at least able to address multiple needs, while also adding a QB who could be a competent starter in Sean Payton’s scheme. Time will tell what the ultimate returns are, but this was a step in the right direction. 
class	pro-football-network	det	b+	Lions fans can feel good about the latest class that Brad Holmes and Dan Campbell put together. Terrion Arnold is a true blue-chip prospect at CB, and Mekhi Wingo and Christian Mahogany were two of the best value acquisitions on Day 3. Both could make a major imprint early in their Lions careers.  There were a few moves that felt redundant or forced. Ennis Rakestraw Jr. is a good player and scheme fit, but the 61st pick could’ve been spent on an EDGE or WR. And trading capital to acquire a potentially positionless hybrid in Vaki wasn’t ideal, either.  Nevertheless, the Lions had a successful stretch in the 2024 NFL Draft overall. And more importantly, they aggressively targeted weaknesses, with the intent of rising back to contention in 2024.  
class	pro-football-network	gb	b-	With a strong, ascending roster, the Packers had a larger margin for error in the 2024 NFL Draft. But that doesn’t change the fact that a few of their picks were reaches on the value board or somewhat redundant with the personnel they’d already acquired.  Marshawn Lloyd and Ty’Ron Hopper, in particular, felt premature on Day 2, while Jordan Morgan will also be pressured to play at a high level right away after going in Round 1.  Nevertheless, for all the uncertainty, picks like Bullard, Monk, and Glover matched fit and value perfectly, and in Round 7 – as they always do – the Packers managed to score a couple of potential buy-low steals. 
class	pro-football-network	hou	b-	Much of the Texans’ grade is predicated on Ryans’ ability to develop the defenders he chose. On paper, Bullock, Hill, and Byrd are solid talents, but they need to be put in a position to succeed. 
class	pro-football-network	ind	a	The Latu and Mitchell selections buoy the class, but Bortolini and a string of DB selections also raise the value.  Even Goncalves and Laulu, who received C- or lower grades, could build productive careers in Indy. GM Chris Ballard obviously had a plan entering the draft, and he executed it. 
class	pro-football-network	jax	b	As with most Trent Baalke drafts, the Jaguars went with high-upside players who could also flame out in a few years. But if they hit on players such as Smith, Foster, and Cole, Jacksonville will be in a position to compete for deep playoff runs. 
class	pro-football-network	kc	a	Once again, Brett Veach put on a masterclass of playing the board and added droves of talent in the process. Worthy is the gem of the class, but Wiley could legitimately be a successor to Kelce on offense, and Suamataia is a starting tackle in waiting.  On defense, Hicks can be a difference-maker at safety with his range and physicality, and all of the Chiefs’ other moves were savvy ones to solidify depth and long-term security. The Chiefs build through the draft, and this class was just a continuation of that.
class	pro-football-network	lv	a	On the surface, Tom Telesco’s first draft with the Raiders was a success. Brock Bowers and Jackson Powers-Johnson were stellar value acquisitions early on, and Glaze has starting upside at the right tackle spot.  On Day 3, the Raiders continued to follow the theme of value, adding high-upside DBs like Richardson, Devonshire, and Taylor, and stopping the fall of a versatile weapon in Laube. The Raiders covered the bases they needed to, and added that extra playmaking flair as well.  
class	pro-football-network	lac	a	There was a sense ahead of the draft that the Chargers wouldn’t be able to hit everything they needed to without trading down from No. 5 overall.  Fast forward to now, and they have a blue-chip starting OT duo, a WR core with new life and variable skill sets, a young and talented defensive back room, new run defense reinforcements up front, and a defensive leader at LB.  The Chargers covered a lot of ground in the 2024 NFL Draft and were able to do so while also making moves of substance at multiple spots. This draft should help kickstart the process of reworking the roster in a competitive AFC West. 
class	pro-football-network	lar	a	Another NFC West team, another A. Sure, I may not be the toughest grader, but look at the Rams’ draft class and point out a clear miss. It was a defensive-focused haul until Day 3, and GM Les Sneed has proven they know how to scout and develop late-round selection.
class	pro-football-network	mia	b-	It was an interesting 2024 NFL Draft for the Miami Dolphins that might not be immediate dividends. Their first two picks, Chop Robinson and Patrick Paul have some high-end athletic traits and measurables that, if they can be developed, could turn them into excellent selections.  However, if you want to see an immediate return on your early-round investments, that’s not likely to happen in Miami.  Although EDGE was considered a need coming into the draft, selecting two pass rushers in the first four picks can be considered excessive, even if the latter selection was great value at pick 158.  Given the rumors circulating before the draft that Miami would take a receiver early, it was somewhat poetic that their biggest wins from a draft spot vs. PFN Big Board ranking perspective were with Malik Washington and Tahj Washington, who should compete to start in the slot in 2024.  
class	pro-football-network	min	a-	The Vikings’ sparse Day 3 class didn’t carry the same kind of weight that other teams’ did in the 2024 NFL Draft. On Day 3, the Vikings added a developmental CB, a kicker, and trench depth on both sides of the ball.  That said, the Day 3 stretch was never going to sway Minnesota’s draft grade too far in either direction, because in Round 1, they added two franchise-defining players on either side of the ball.  J.J. McCarthy has a legitimate chance to be Minnesota’s next franchise QB with the support he’s been given. And at 17th overall, Dallas Turner is a superb value addition, with the tools to wreck offensive game plans. That duo alone made Minnesota’s class a success. 
class	pro-football-network	ne	b+	The Bill Belichick era in New England is well and truly over. The Patriots put together an exciting offensive class, the like of which hasn’t been seen in Foxboro recently, perhaps not ever. Headlined by quarterback Drake Maye, the number one overall player on the PFN Big Board, there can be genuine enthusiasm about what New England’s offense can become in the future.  The franchise surrounded him with a plethora of skill players in the 2024 NFL Draft too, with Ja’Lynn Polk and Javon Baker providing excellent outlets, not to mention the versatile and athletic Jaheim Bell.  While we’re gushing over the skill player additions, it’s worth tempering excitement over the class as a whole because both Caedan Wallace and Layden Robinson were a significant reach at positions of need on the offensive front. Thankfully, Maye has the athletic ability to extend plays when placed under pressure.  
class	pro-football-network	no	b+	The Saints’ top priority was to add talent along the offensive line unit, with offensive tackle Ryan Ramczyk’s immediate future currently up in the air. They did exactly that by selecting Oregon State offensive tackle Taliese Fuaga at No. 14 overall to instantly slide into whatever role necessary to improve this unit upfront.  They also traded up for Alabama cornerback Kool-Aid McKinstry in the second round, which helped limit their draft assets the rest of the way. While the addition of Spencer Rattler isn’t helpful for this season, the pick of Northern Iowa DT Khristian Boyd is amongst the best value picks in the entire draft. 
class	pro-football-network	nyg	b+	The New York Giants were clearly looking to surround Daniel Jones with the talent to either elevate his game or prove, once and for all, that he isn’t long for the roster. Malik Nabers is the most explosive wide receiver he’s had while with the franchise, and Day 3 picks Theo Johnson and Tyrone Tracy Jr. bolster the offense in their own unique ways.  The playmakers selected in the secondary on Day 2 should have an immediate and apparent impact, but it was somewhat surprising to see the Giants come away from the NFL’s annual selection event without adding any form of offensive line upgrades. 
class	pro-football-network	nyj	a-	The New York Jets, like it or loathe it, will revolve around Aaron Rodgers in the short term, and their 2024 NFL Draft has a similar storyline. The franchise did a great job of protecting their current signal caller with the selection of Olu Fashanu – a move made better by dropping a spot in a trade with Minnesota.  Malachi Corley was good value in the third as a dangerous RAC weapon for Rodgers in the short term and then for potential long term QB, Jordan Travis. Injury impacted his stock but Travis has the hallmarks of an NFL QB. 
class	pro-football-network	phi	a-	At the risk of sounding sycophantic, the 2024 NFL Draft was another masterclass from Howie Roseman. Looking at individual grades for each pick, the overall grade is likely closer to a B+ than the A- we’ve given it here.  However, you have to take into account the sheer value of the first two picks that the Eagles made in Detroit. Quinyon Mitchell can be a lockdown corner in the league, and the value in landing Cooper DeJean with the 40th overall pick while moving around the board like Garry Kasparov was something spectacular.  There were rookie contributors selected at multiple positions of need, and both sides of the ball got an influence of excellent talent.  If you were looking to pick fault, the offensive line additions possibly weren’t of the caliber that fans might have hoped for as they look to a post-Jason Kelce era that could also be Lane Johnson-less in the not-too-distant future. That shouldn’t detract from the excellent work done by the franchise.  
class	pro-football-network	pit	a	Normally, when a team heavily focuses on just one position group for an entire draft, that could be a recipe for disaster. Yet, the Pittsburgh Steelers’ ability to land Washington offensive tackle Troy Fautanu, West Virginia center Zach Frazier, and South Dakota State guard Mason McCormick felt more like a masterpiece on how to revamp your offensive line instantly.  The selection of NC State linebacker Payton Wilson further managed to solidify this group as an excellent overall class for the Steelers in 2024.  
class	pro-football-network	sf	b-	From a quick glance, it seems like the 49ers reached on all of their selections. But reaching is relevant, and each pick – sans Guerendo – added talent to positions of need. Pearsall received a C+ due to his position on the board compared to where he was selected, but if San Francisco deals Samuel or Aiyuk and the Florida WR balls out, then the grade is null and void. 
class	pro-football-network	sea	a	Outside of an errant backup TE selection, the Seahawks targeted key weaknesses in the roster while also keeping an eye toward the future. Murphy and Haynes highlight Macdonald’s emphasis on the trenches nabbing Pritchett and James on Day 3 bolstered the secondary. 
class	pro-football-network	tb	b+	The Tampa Bay Buccaneers managed to hit a pair of home runs early in the draft by landing arguably the best interior offensive line prospect in the class — Duke’s Graham Barton — at No. 26 overall, but they followed it up by selecting Alabama edge rusher Chris Braswell when they fell in general manager Jason Licht’s lap at No. 57 overall.  Washington WR Jalen McMillan at No. 92 overall was another solid pick, but missteps with Georgia safety Tykee Smith (89th overall) and Oregon running back Bucky Irving (125th overall) prevent this class from receiving an elite grade. 
class	pro-football-network	ten	b+	Tennessee added size and speed on defense while drafting a long-term left tackle and a depth piece at receiver for Levis. If Sweat puts all his focus on football and Gray and Williams play notable snaps on defense, the Titans will be set for the future at the first two levels on the defensive side of the ball.
class	pro-football-network	was	b+	The moves that Washington made to open the 2024 NFL Draft speaks to the sea change taking place within the program. It’s a whole new world from top to bottom of the front office, and they were aggressive and successful early on, taking franchise difference makers in Jayden Daniels, Johnny Newton, Mike Sainristil, and Ben Sinnott.  The Commanders were running at an A- grade after Day 2, but some of their moves on Day 3 failed to live up to the excitement of the opening salvo. Jordan Magee is a solid, perhaps underrated get at linebacker, and Dominique Hampton could be a playmaker at the heart of the secondary. 
class	nfl	ari	a-	The Cardinals did a nice job over the first two days of the draft. They acquired picks via trade, found home-run hitters on offense in Harrison and Benson and added an inside/outside pass-rush threat in Robinson. They landed athletic corners in Melton and Elijah Jones, as well. Adams and Reiman also met needs, though they were picked a bit earlier than I expected.     Taylor-Demerson was my pick for the Cardinals in the fourth round of my seven-round mock draft because of his quickness as a slot defender and tackling ability. Thomas is athletic enough to stand up on the edge for the Cardinals, while Christian Jones and Palmer have the talent to take back-end roster spots and compete for playing time down the road. 
class	nfl	atl	c+	It was a strange draft for the Falcons, primarily because of the Penix selection, which was perplexing given their investment in Kirk Cousins this offseason. Penix’s strong arm and accuracy from the pocket could make him a star if the injury woes that plagued him at Indiana don’t return. Trading up to grab the athletic Orhorhoro was a reach, in my opinion, especially given the team's need at corner. Trice met a crucial need on the edge.    Dorlus fits the mold of Atlanta's defensive linemen. He should be able to play 5-technique or 3-technique depending on where he is needed. Bertrand should contribute on special teams before moving to defense in time. McClellan and Washington -- who broke out as a senior at Illinois -- offer depth at the skill positions. They'll need to find cornerbacks in the undrafted free agent pool after failing to address the position in the draft.
class	nfl	bal	a-	The Ravens had yet another solid draft. Wiggins' elite recovery speed earned him a first-round slot, but he must answer questions about how his lean frame and inconsistent tackling translates to the next level. Rosengarten and Isaac were great value picks at two need spots.     I liked the selection of Walker, an outside playmaker, early in Round 4, even after the team re-upped Rashod Bateman. Tampa's size and strength at the catch point made him worthy of a Day 2 pick, but Baltimore landed him on Day 3. Ali is coming off a biceps injury suffered at the Senior Bowl. Leary's arm and experience gained him a draft spot. Samac's a powerful interior lineman. 
class	nfl	buf	b+	Buffalo found the potential big-play receiver it needed in Coleman after trading down twice in Round 1 (for relatively small gain). It will be interesting to see if dealing with the Chiefs so Kansas City could pick speedy pass-catcher Xavier Worthy comes back to bite the Bills. Bishop should be a good starter. Carter adds determination and leadership to the defensive line, although he was picked a bit earlier than I expected.    Davis' tenacity as a runner is the perfect complement to James Cook. I projected Van Pran-Granger to the Bills a bit later in the fifth round in my final mock draft, but he was still a good value for a stout pivot. Securing a 2025 fourth-round pick for a fifth-rounder this year in a trade with the Bears will pay dividends down the road. Solomon is shorter than most Bills edge rushers, but he gets to the quarterback. Hardy could be a nickel candidate and is a strong return man. 
class	nfl	car	b	Carolina gave up what eventually turned into the No. 1 overall pick in this year’s draft as part of last year's trade to select quarterback Bryce Young. The Panthers moved up a spot to pick Legette at the end of Round 1. He will need to show he was a better pick than several other receivers selected in the second round. Brooks should be an excellent back once recovered from his knee injury. Wallace was an excellent value in Round 3 and can take over for Frankie Luvu, who exited in free agency.     Sanders is a smooth pass-catching tight end who will be looking to outperform past Carolina draft picks Ian Thomas and Tommy Tremble. Smith-Wade is quicker than fast, making life difficult for receivers by sticking like glue. 
class	nfl	chi	a-	Williams and Odunze, combined with DJ Moore and Keenan Allen, could give the Bears their best passing attack since the merger. The second-round pick that was dealt to Washington for Montez Sweat should pay off now that his contract has been extended. Amegadjie should contribute as a backup in 2024 and has potential to start down the road.    Taylor has a good leg and had plenty of reps at Iowa, but I believe picking him in the fourth round was a reach. Booker has potential as an edge rusher, but the Bears had to give up a 2025 fourth-round selection to get him because they had unloaded their other Day 3 picks in previous trades. They improved their interior offensive line by sending a fifth-round pick to Buffalo for Ryan Bates earlier this offseason.  
class	nfl	cin	b-	Mims is a boom-or-bust pick at tackle. He certainly has the size to win at the next level, but his limited experience (eight starts at Georgia) is a concern. The team doubled up on defensive tackles on Day 2 as it looks to replace D.J. Reader. Burton presented excellent value. He could become a key contributor on offense, especially if the Bengals and Tee Higgins don’t work out a long-term agreement.    Cincinnati was part of the tight end run in the fourth round, picking All despite injury concerns. Newton had a tough go at times during his senior year, but he could prove to be a nice find in the fifth round. Same goes for sixth-rounders McLachlan and Johnson. The Bengals picked Anthony with the seventh-round pick acquired from Houston for running back Joe Mixon. 
class	nfl	cle	c+	The Browns' 2022 trade for Deshaun Watson is still very much a work in progress; the QB's performance thus far has not provided the team with much of a return on the raft of picks shipped to Houston, including first- and fourth-round picks this year. Hall and Zinter stay in Big Ten Country, with the former Buckeye looking to wreak havoc on the defensive line and Zinter likely to bounce back from injury to be a long-term starter.    Cleveland did not have many Day 3 picks because of past trades, including one this offseason for receiver Jerry Jeudy. Thrash could work himself into the role of a fourth or fifth receiver because of his speed. Nathaniel Watson's ferocious nature meets a need in the middle of the team's defense late in the draft, and Harden was one of the steals of the seventh round because of his fierceness and athleticism. 
class	nfl	dal	a-	Gaining a third-round pick in a move down the board and still landing a starting tackle made for a successful Thursday night for Dallas. Kneeland and Beebe should prove to be excellent values, while Liufau will be a solid addition to the middle of the Cowboys' defense. The Notre Dame 'backer was picked a bit early for my taste, though.    In Round 5, Dallas added Carson, a versatile corner/safety who was considered a Day 2 prospect near the start of last season. Flournoy has the tools to make the squad his rookie year. The Cowboys did not take a running back with any of their eight picks, leaving a sizable hole on their roster they'll still need to fill this offseason. Dallas had four picks within the top 90 selections, but were without a fourth-rounder, having sent theirs to San Francisco last August for Trey Lance. That investment could work out quite well if the former No. 3 overall pick is able to find his game at the pro level. 
class	nfl	den	b-	Time will tell whether Nix will be a top-notch starting NFL quarterback or viewed as a reach by a team in desperate need of talent under center. Time will also tell whether the 2023 first- and 2024 second-rounders the Broncos sent the Saints to acquire coach Sean Payton (along with a 2024 third-round pick) will lead to a championship in Denver.    Elliss isn’t a fantastic athlete but was productive at a need position for Utah, where he played for his father, former NFL lineman Luther Elliss. Denver traded up early in Round 4 to unite Franklin with Nix; the former is not the toughest receiver, but he can make defenders miss after the catch. The Broncos then found value at corner in wiry competitor Abrams-Draine before grabbing a power back in Estimé. 
class	nfl	det	b	The Lions doubled up at corner in the first and second rounds, flexing their aggressiveness by trading a third-rounder to move up for Arnold instead of staying put and possibly selecting his ‘Bama teammate, Kool-Aid McKinstry. Detroit got fair value on Rakestraw at the end of Round 2, though the team also could have used another edge rusher or receiver.     With Taylor Decker and Penei Sewell already in place at the two bookends, the Lions were one of the few teams able to take a chance on a massive, super-athletic tackle like Manu, a developmental prospect out of Canada. Vaki could turn out to be a hammer of a running back and special teamer, but the 32-spot jump to get him cost Detroit its fourth-rounder next year. 
class	nfl	gb	b	Morgan's pass-protection skills give him a chance to replace three-time Pro Bowler David Bakhtiari at left tackle, or he could prove himself a nice positional blocker at guard, allowing the Packers to get their five best linemen on the field together. Cooper and Bullard were excellent picks in Round 2, with both filling needs, but I was a bit ambivalent on the team using third-round selections on a running back (albeit a good one in Lloyd) and a second linebacker.    Monk and Glover should provide depth on the offensive line, while Williams’ reliable tackling should make him a good special teams player. Trading a pick to move up for a second safety didn’t seem like the best value, though -- especially when you consider Green Bay took another safety just one round later. Oladapo is also a quality defender, but using three choices on the same position means the team must now rely on free-agent edge rushers and 3-techniques to round out the defense. Pratt was an excellent value pick late in the draft, as was King, who has more upside than his pre-draft evaluation might suggest.  
class	nfl	hou	a-	Houston built on the momentum from last season’s playoff run with a strong 2024 draft plan. The pre-draft trade with Minnesota to move out of the No. 23 overall slot -- and out of Round 1 entirely -- netted the Texans a 2025 second-rounder and didn’t prevent them from addressing a roster sore spot with Lassiter. The Vikings used their original second-round pick on Fisher, who still needs more polish to his game. Time will tell whether Bullock was the right pick over the numerous other safeties still on the board.    Stover was an excellent choice in Round 4. He’ll be reunited with C.J. Stroud, who frequently leaned on the tight end on third downs when the two were teammates at Ohio State. Hill should be a special teams demon. Acquiring veteran running back Joe Mixon for a seventh-round pick earlier this offseason also factors into the grade above. 
class	nfl	ind	b+	Latu was the most consistent pass rusher in the draft class and will be productive if the neck injury he suffered while at Washington is not an issue moving forward. The team found a potential steal in Mitchell, provided his game matures, while trading down for two Day 3 picks. Trading up for Gonclaves seemed unnecessary, though he should be at least a solid swing tackle; he's been recovering from a foot injury but said after the draft that he feels 100%.    Bortolini looks like Ryan Kelly's heir apparent; he also has the experience, strength and athleticism to play guard until needed in the middle. Gould brings real value as a returner, especially with the new kickoff rules. Carlies moves from safety to linebacker for the Colts. Simpson could man corner or safety; the athletic defender played both spots in college. Abraham is the son of former NFL player Donnie Abraham and a tough-minded corner in his own right, but the team is still looking for depth at edge.  
class	nfl	jax	a-	Trading down for three picks (including two mid-rounders in 2025) and still landing a downfield target like Thomas was a win for the Jaguars. Smith and Jones filled needs with good value in the second and third rounds, respectively. Calvin Ridley restarted his career in Jacksonville, but essentially renting the receiver in exchange for two picks (including a third-rounder this year) did not really pay off for the Jags.    Foster provides depth at offensive tackle and could start in 2025 if Cam Robinson and Walker Little do not return. Defensive tackle Jefferson joined Smith in fortifying the defensive line. Prince is a great athlete at cornerback. Robinson will be a change-of-pace back and explosive returner. The team got backup quarterback Mac Jones for a sixth-round pick this offseason. Starting guard Ezra Cleveland was also acquired for a sixth-rounder last October; he re-signed in March. 
class	nfl	kc	a	If you're wondering how the Chiefs stay on top, just look at this draft haul. Worthy is the sort of speedy difference-maker the Chiefs have searched for since trading Tyreek Hill away in 2022, and they did not give up much value to AFC rival Buffalo in the trade up to select him. They also did not have to reach for Suamataia, who should work himself into the lineup at tackle or guard if he's able to improve on his footwork.    Wiley's potential as a mismatch against smaller defenders made him one of the top picks of the fourth round. Hicks joins past Chiefs picks L'Jarius Sneed and Chamarri Conner as yet another potential bargain defensive back in the fourth round. Nourzad could start at center or guard in the NFL. They'll be looking for corners, running backs and linebackers after the draft. 
class	nfl	lv	b-	Bowers was too strong a value to ignore and will be a nice third-down and red-zone option for whomever is quarterbacking the squad over the next decade. Powers-Johnson was also a good find in the mid-second at a position of need. Glaze will need to show he was picked at the right time by eventually earning a starting spot.    Richardson is exactly the kind of NFL-sized, physical corner the Raiders required. Eichenberg will be a reliable inside player for many years. Laube was a nice pick in the sixth round who will get carries off the bench and be a special teams ace. No quarterback was selected to enter the competition between Aidan O'Connell and Gardner Minshew, so that position should be their top priority in rookie free agency.  
class	nfl	lac	a-	Alt will doubtlessly be a good offensive tackle for the next decade or more, but Chargers fans will keep one eye on receiver Malik Nabers, who went sixth overall to the Giants, to see if he would have been a better pick. McConkey could quiet any such concerns with his quickness and excellent routes if able to stay health. Head coach Jim Harbaugh found a leader on defense in Colson, who played that role for Harbaugh at Michigan.     Eboigbe fits as a rotational defensive lineman who gives full effort on each play. Hart and Still fulfill the team's need at corner for good value, and Rice (son of Hall of Famer Jerry Rice) and Johnson were needed for a thin receiver room. Vidal is a low-center-of-gravity back who could take over for departed veteran Austin Ekeler if veteran JK Dobbins is not ready to go following last year's torn Achilles. 
class	nfl	lar	a-	The run on offensive players in Round 1 allowed the Rams to land a bargain edge rusher (which they really needed) in Verse, their first first-round pick since 2016. Fiske will help make up for the loss of Aaron Donald to retirement, but we'll have to see if it made sense to trade a 2025 second-rounder to acquire him instead of getting Michael Hall at their original pick (No. 52; he went to the Browns 54th overall). Corum will play bigger and faster than his numbers indicate, and Kinchens is a downhill player at a soft spot for the Rams.    Jackson and Davis bolster the depth on the defensive line with former Florida State teammates Verse and Fiske. The Rams needed to find a kicker in his draft, and they chose Karty over Cam Little (who went to the Jags at No. 212). Limmer and Leveston should be long-time pros at center and guard, respectively. Rookie cornerbacks not drafted this weekend should be getting calls from the Rams.
class	nfl	mia	b-	Miami needed another edge rusher, especially with Jaelan Phillips coming off an Achilles injury and Bradley Chubb coming off a torn ACL, but Robinson must show he can be a factor in the run game and convert pressures into sacks more regularly in the NFL. Left tackle Terron Armstead's difficulty staying on the field made Paul a good pick in the second round. The teams' forfeiture of its third-round pick dragged down its grade.    Trading a future third-round pick for a fourth in the current draft is usually not wise, and Miami has a few backs in the stable already, but finding a potential star in Wright waiting around made it easier to swallow. It would not surprise me if the relentless Kamara is as productive as Robinson early in his career. Both pass-catchers with the surname Washington (not related) will flourish as tough-minded slot receivers in Mike McDaniel's offense. 
class	nfl	min	b+	The Vikings gave up pick value in 2023, Day 3 picks this year and much of their 2025 draft in moves that landed them McCarthy, tight end T.J. Hockenson (in a 2022 deadline deal with Detroit) and edge rusher Turner. McCarthy and Turner possess the skill set to make that investment worthwhile, though McCarthy will need to continue his winning ways at the next level and Turner must be an impact defender.     Jackson is a Riq Woolen-type corner, long and quick-footed, who presents excellent value in the fourth round. Rouse is a strong, experienced lineman who takes over for departed veteran Oli Udoh as the swing tackle. Don't overlook Jurgens' chances of making the roster. Reichard is the FBS' all-time leading scorer, and the Vikings need a reliable field goal kicker; I'm interested in how his career compares with that of Cam Little, who was picked by the Jags with pick No. 212.
class	nfl	ne	b	New England needed a new signal-caller in the worst way. Refining Maye's skills could help the team compete in the AFC East over the next few seasons. The selections of Polk and Wallace addressed needs for the Patriots, but we'll see if staying put in the second round to take Ladd McConkey -- instead of trading down -- and focusing on a different position early in Round 3 would have been better choices.    Robinson should have been a third-round pick, so I understood the selection, even after the team's investment in interior lineman in last year's draft. It would not surprise me if Baker turned out to be just as good as Polk in two years because of his ability to win downfield. The team picked the strong-armed but inconsistent Milton with the sixth-round selection it acquired from the Jaguars for Mac Jones. 
class	nfl	no	a-	New Orleans took a step forward in the NFC South race this weekend. Fuaga and the Saints seemed like a perfect pairing, with the nasty lineman fitting the team's mold and filling a big need. They traded up in Round 2 for McKinstry, a potential first-round value at a position where you can never have enough talent.    Rattler will learn how to lead a team and take advantage of his physical gifts from a consummate professional in Derek Carr. He should compete against Jake Haener for the backup spot. Means is a tough receiver with athleticism and could fight for a roster spot. Ford's a pounder inside and I love Boyd's value in the sixth round. He can stuff run plays and get in the face of quarterbacks more often than you'd think. 
class	nfl	nyg	b+	The Giants ignored the historic quarterback run early on to grab Nabers, an explosive receiver with a game similar to the team's 2014 first-rounder, Odell Beckham Jr. We'll see if sticking with Daniel Jones and Drew Lock instead of taking another QB was the correct move. Nubin and Phillips were fair value in the secondary, where the team needed more talent.    Johnson will be an excellent fourth-round pick if he can fully translate his athleticism to the field. Tracy is an offensive weapon in the making, whether at running back or receiver. Muasau will be a starter in the league despite being picked in the sixth.  
class	nfl	nyj	b+	Even after picking up veteran tackles Tyron Smith and Morgan Moses this offseason, the Jets selected Fashanu to help protect Aaron Rodgers. They spent their second-rounder on Rodgers last year and moved up for the tough-running Corley to improve the talent surrounding the future Hall of Famer.    The Jets did well picking up a 2025 third-rounder for one of their fourth-round selections. Adding in the big, nimble Allen to the backfield behind Breece Hall and Israel Abanikanda makes sense given how injuries have impacted depth at the position. I projected the Jets to bring in productive team leader Travis on Day 3, so trading up for him in the fifth wasn't surprising. Stiggers is a fantastic story, coming through the CFL to the NFL, and a competitive athlete outside. 
class	nfl	phi	a-	Don't forget about the Eagles when identifying 2024 NFC title contenders, especially after this draft. Getting Mitchell to help the cornerback room without having to trade up was a major win. They moved up for DeJean like Detroit did for Brian Branch last year; I suspect he'll have a similar impact as a rookie. Hunt's potential on the edge was worth the third-round pick. The grade reflects the trade of this year's third-round pick for cornerback Kelee Ringo last year; the result is still uncertain.     General manager Howie Roseman traded several times Saturday, flipping the script on last year's Ringo deal by getting 2025 third- and fifth-round selections. All-purpose back Shipley and receiver Smith will likely play on special teams and the offense as rookies. My favorite pick of the day was Roseman trading for Trotter, a fine player and legacy pick for the Eagles. McMahon could start at center this year if Cam Jurgens does not, and Keegan was a great pick late to add youth to the guard depth chart. 
class	nfl	pit	a	It was just another value-filled draft for Pittsburgh. It was likely the Steelers would take offensive linemen on Day 1 or 2, and they found good value in Fautanu and Frazier. Both Wilsons selected on Day 2 were also fantastic finds and should make impacts in 2024 and beyond.     The Steelers went O-line again on Day 3, getting McCormick at least a round later than I placed his value because of his toughness and athleticism. Lee is a nice sixth-round pick who will excel at 5-technique due to his strength and motor. Watts will get a chance to use his physicality in the secondary, though the team could have used an earlier pick at cornerback instead of picking three offensive linemen. 
class	nfl	sf	b	Pearsall's quickness and hands warranted first-round consideration, and the team needed a receiver with the potential trading away of Deebo Samuel or Brandon Aiyuk down the road. The 49ers could have also picked a cornerback or tackle at that spot. Green and Puni will contribute in areas of need, but trading up for Puni was a bit of a stretch. They did not re-sign Chase Young after sending a third to Washington at the deadline.     Mustapha, picked with the selection gained from Dallas for quarterback Trey Lance, should see time on defense and special teams as a rookie. The 49ers hope to get more from Guerendo than recent running back picks Trey Sermon and Tyrion Davis-Price. Cowing is small but crafty, and Kingston's guard/tackle versatility makes him a valuable backup. 
class	nfl	sea	a	Murphy was always the pick for Seattle if available at No. 16 because of his ability to pressure quarterbacks and play the run. Haynes will start as a rookie for the Seahawks due to his athleticism and toughness. Re-upping defensive lineman Leonard Williams paid off the second-round investment in that trade with the Giants.    Knight is the strong tackler the Seahawks needed in the middle of their defense, though others like Jeremiah Trotter Jr. were available. Barner is a reliable receiver and blocker who can replace Will Dissly. Pritchett should have been picked much earlier. Laumea played well at tackle but projects as a power blocker at guard. No edge rushers were selected, so I suspect a couple top undrafted free agents will be signed. 
class	nfl	tb	b+	Barton's versatility, intelligence and toughness will make him one of the top linemen in this draft despite falling into the back part of the first round. Braswell met the team's need for an edge rusher but will need to prove he was worth his draft standing. Smith should contribute immediately, and McMillan could be a playmaker as his game matures.    The Buccaneers could have picked Will Shipley over Irving, but the former Oregon Duck will compete for playing time with Chase Edmonds as a complementary back in 2024. Another interior lineman was picked in Klein, but no cornerbacks were brought on board. 
class	nfl	ten	a-	With Joe Alt off the board, the Titans picked the other top 10-caliber tackle. Latham's a wall on the outside who will excel on either side of the line. The team needed a big body like Sweat on the defensive line and chose him even after Sweat's recent DWI arrest; GM Ran Carthon said he discussed the incident with Sweat, and that Sweat "accepted his responsibility." Tennessee will hope he can be dominant at the next level. The Titans' third-round pick was part of the package to move up for quarterback Will Levis last April.    Gray's recognition skills and quickness make him a fit in the middle of Tennessee's defense. Brownlee has the talent to step into the fray as a rookie and earn a starting job down the line. Jackson's quickness helps fill two needs: depth at receiver and as a returner. Harrell should have been picked much earlier as an edge rusher, a spot where the Titans needed depth. 
class	nfl	was	a-	The Commanders entered a new era with an excellent draft. Daniels could be an elite dual-threat playmaker if he becomes more efficient from the pocket. Newton is a force in the front four. Sainristil is a pain for opposing receivers to handle. Sinnott is an underappreciated receiving/blocking weapon. Coleman is a powerful guard/tackle. And McCaffrey is a reliable WR2 or WR3 option.    Washington did not have a fourth-round pick after moving up to the third in the Sam Howell trade with Seattle. It found a future starting linebacker in Magee, whose explosiveness was underappreciated while he was playing at Temple. Hampton possesses a nice combination of size and quickness, and it won't be surprising if he plays as a rookie. 
class	the-sporting-news	pit	a+	Outside of some pass-rush depth, which wasn't a big need, the Steelers destroyed this draft with GM Omar Khan and coach Mike Tomlin. That builds on an amazing offseason when they got Russell Wilson and Justin Fields as QB options for almost nothing. Fautanu and Frazier will start and star right away with 2023 first-round Broderick Jones moving to left tackle. Roman Wilson is the ideal playmaker to pair with George Pickens. It's also not fair Payton Wilson will roam a second level and make plays right with Patrick Queen.   
class	the-sporting-news	phi	a	GM Howie Roseman somehow ended up with arguably the two best corners in the class to fill a big need. Hunt can tap into his big small-school pass-rush upside for Vic Fangio. Shipley, Smith, and Wilson are valuable, versatile cogs for Jalen Hurts to support Saquon Barkley, the expensive wideouts, and tight ends. 
class	the-sporting-news	was	a	New GM Adam Peters hopes to flip all the past bad vibes and Daniels' upside as a passer and runner for Kliff Kingsbury is a great start. Defensive-minded Dan Quinn had to love Newton and Sainristil back-to-back to help push this group toward what he had in Dallas. Sinnott and McCaffrey add interesting spread weapons to Terry McLaurin, Jahan Dotson, Austin Ekeler, and Zach Ertz. Then, Quinn got more of what he needed late, too. 
class	the-sporting-news	bal	a	The Ravens once again locked into their key positions of need under Eric DeCosta and practiced patience in letting values drop to them. Wiggins and Tampa have a chance to be a special starting cornerback duo in time. Issac is their style of edge rusher, while Walker provides a key missing element at receiver to help Zay Flowers and Rashod Bateman. Baltimore doesn't make bad picks in relation to having the right talent available. Ali added needed backfield depth behind Derrick Henry, and Leary is a good developmental athlete. 
class	the-sporting-news	cin	a	The Bengals once again knew what they were doing. Mims was the ideal fit to upgrade Joe Burrow's pass protection, while Burton gives him an exciting new big-play slot. All and McLachlan bring good blocking and short-to-intermediate area receiving to their scheme, too. Jenkins and Jackson provides a good 1-2 pass-rushing and run-stuffing punch. Newton was right for their corner depth, too. 
class	the-sporting-news	lac	a	Who has it better than coach Jim Harbaugh? Only a few teams. He helped new GM Joe Hortiz nail this critical draft, getting an elite pass protector and top new versatile target for Justin Herbert. Colson was the right Michigan man to add, flipping a weakness into a strength. Still and Hart bring key depth, and Vidal is a good all-around contingency for former Ravens Gus Edwards and JK Dobbins. Rice and Johnson provide some big-play options to help replace Mike Williams and provide contingency for Quentin Johnston. 
class	the-sporting-news	min	a	The Vikings could have rested on McCarthy for their passing game and both Turner and Jackson for the pass defense and had a solid draft. GM Kwesi Adofo-Mensah didn't waste time pleasing Kevin O'Connell and Brian Flores to accelerate a rebuild. They made good use of moving up to go for high-upside quality over pure quantity. Reichard also filled a key need. 
class	the-sporting-news	det	a	The Lions didn't have much unfinished business after GM Brad Holmes crushed the draft and free agency in the two previous seasons. The top of that list by far was getting two starting-caliber cornerbacks who could fit well and make a lot of plays in Aaron Glenn's scheme. Arnold and Rakestraw can help clean up the makeshift mess from 2023.
class	the-sporting-news	chi	a-	GM Ryan Poles has to be thrilled at the look of his new offense with Williams taking the controls and Odunze joining D.J. Moore, Keenan Allen, D'Andre Swift, and Gerald Everett as his promising mix of skill support. They also got an intriguing pass protector for him in Amegadjie. Taylor docks them for a weird reach, but getting back into the draft to nab Booker was nice. The only key absence of the class is a defensive tackle.
class	the-sporting-news	den	a-	The Broncos didn't reach at all for Nix despite him being the sixth QB off the board because Sean Payton was confident he would be the ideal accurate passer for his scheme. Getting Franklin later to remain his go-to guy was the steal of the draft. Elliss and Abrams-Draine will make a lot of plays on the back end for Vance Joseph. Estime gives them the much-needed power back with burst to complement Javonte Williams. 
class	the-sporting-news	lar	a-	The Rams, finally back in the first round under GM Les Snead, would have been "B" just on the strength of taking Verse and Fiske from the same Florida State defense back-to-back to help new coordinator Chris Shula. Those were the high-priority positions, and safety was also addressed. Corum adds the right change-of-backup to Kyren Williams for Sean McVay. 
class	the-sporting-news	ne	a-	The Patriots did pretty well with new GM Eliot Wolf and new coach Jerod Mayo in the first draft of the post-Bill Belichick era. The key was the much-needed refocus on offense, starting with Maye and taking a shot at another high-ceiling QB later just in case with Milton. Polk and Baker were the best picks to upgrade the weaponry for those rookies inside and out. Wallace and Robinson were considerable reaches, but they did fall in line with needs up front. 
class	the-sporting-news	kc	a-	The Chiefs may have gotten a little too aggressive and speed-happy to land Worthy over worthier first-round wideouts, but it made sense from the perspective to keep adding deep threats for Patrick Mahomes. Suamataia and Nourzad might be their latest offensive line steals. Wiley, out of Andy Reid's alma mater BYU, was a good developmental as a high-ceiling athlete behind Travis Kelce. Hicks might end up being the best overall pick and is ideal for Steve Spagnuolo's defense. 
class	the-sporting-news	tb	b+	The Buccaneers did well again with GM Jason Licht, who made upgrading the offensive line a priority with the versatile and dominant Barton. Todd Bowles also got two key reinforcements, minus a linebacker, in Braswell and Smith. McMillan and Irving add a little more juice to the receiving core and backfield. 
class	the-sporting-news	nyj	b+	The Jets maintained an offensive theme for GM Joe Douglas with the intent of making Aaron Rodgers' Year 2 much more promising once he's ready to go again. Fashanu gives them a tackle contingency for aging additions, while Corley and Allen fit well playing off Garrett Wilson as a receiver and Breece Hall as a runner. Travis was a good developmental add behind Rogers and Tyrod Taylor. Stiggers gives them a pro-ready corner from the CFL, to boot. Pretty good for New York, even minus volume. 
class	the-sporting-news	hou	b	The Texans had a sneaky supporting draft for what they did with DeMeco Ryans and C.J. Stroud as the rookie foundations last season. Lassiter and Bullock fill key needs in the secondary behind Will Anderson Jr. Fisher has them thinking ahead on Stroud's protection, and Stover gives him a familiar college target. 
class	the-sporting-news	gb	b	GM Brian Gutekunst came through to fill key needs with the first three picks. Morgan can be their new left tackle soon to replace David Bakhtiari. Cooper and Bullard give them a lot more impact in the back seven. Lloyd can be a key cog playing off Josh Jacobs. The rest is shaky despite the volume, leading to a slip just below "A" status. 
class	the-sporting-news	ari	b	Harrison and Robinson alone would give this busy class a high floor. Harrison is a can't-miss go-to guy for Kyler Murray, and Robinson should thrive for defensive-minded Jonathan Gannon. GM Monti Ossenfort had massive volume and could afford to take a few calculated positional risks afterward. Between Melton and Jones, there wasn't good value, but landing Taylor-Demerson later was a redemptive move. This comes down to Harrison and Robinson being awesome, immediate impact players for the passing game and pass rush. 
class	the-sporting-news	buf	b	The Bills were methodical in addressing their key needs under GM Brandon Beane, but they chose not to be too aggressive in doing so. They settled for Coleman as their future No. 1 of choice after trading back and helping the Chiefs. Bishop, Carter, and late-round steal Solomon can be maximized by defensive-minded Sean McDermott. Davis and Van Pran-Granger are good depth boosts for the running game.
class	the-sporting-news	no	b	Fuaga was the ideal pick to fill the biggest need, and McKinstry was a great second-round value to upgrade the defensive playmaking for Dennis Allen. Rattler was an interesting pick for a faller with some starting upside behind Derek Carr. Overall, the class was solid but nothing too spectacular, leading to the appropriate grade.   
class	the-sporting-news	ten	b-	Credit GM Ran Carthon for being methodical in addressing the most important needs of offensive line, defensive line, and linebacker right away and still coming back to make sure they got at least one upside wideout in the mix for Will Levis. Sweat is an obvious high-risk pick with the potential for big reward, and Latham was worthy early. Watch out for Gray thriving, too. 
class	the-sporting-news	sea	b-	Murphy and Hayens were a great start to the draft for both interior line needs, but then the next-best pick was James. GM John Schneider continued to look at the board differently than most teams, but it wasn't his best work to kick off the post-Pete Carroll era with Mike Macdonald.   
class	the-sporting-news	nyg	b-	Nabers and Nubin will be immediate contributing starters, but everything else is rather thin. The Giants, after making such a big deal of thinking about a QB vs. Daniel Jones, didn't go there. Phillips, Johnson, and Tracy were all depth reaches for GM Joe Schoen to boot. 
class	the-sporting-news	ind	b-	Latu and Mitchell were absolute coups to start the draft for GM Chris Ballard. Indy reached a little for offensive line and secondary help, but that extra depth was needed for the defense. Gould brings one more versatile weapon for second-year QB Anthony Richardson, too. 
class	the-sporting-news	dal	c	The Cowboys settled for Guyton in the first round after some more plug-and-play blocking-ready players were taken ahead of him. He likely will need time to be groomed as Tyron Smith's replacement. Beebe has a better chance to start. Kneeland and Liufau fit their schemes, but they did reach a little for both. 
class	the-sporting-news	car	c	The Panthers struggled a bit with new GM Dan Morgan in terms of acquiring the best available talent, but at least they went through thinking about key weapons to boost Bryce Young in Year 2 after his rookie shakiness. Legette may not be able to see regular snaps early, and Sanders also needs some time. Brooks was a bit of a forced luxury and is coming off a major knee injury. 
class	the-sporting-news	mia	c	This seemed like the biggest "forced hand" of a draft class, as the Dolphins had to be dedicated to depth with some injury edge concerns up front (Bradley Chubb, Jaelan Phillips). Paul was thinking beyond Terron Armstead, while they hope Washington can give them a key No. 3. Wright is a fine talent, but for them, he's just a Mike McDaniel luxury pick to a position of strength. 
class	the-sporting-news	cle	c	The Browns had limited volume with no first- or fourth-rounder, and for a team trying to compete better in the tough AFC North with Deshaun Watson, this is below average in both quantity and quality. Andrew Berry will need to hope enough was done in free agency for a playoff return with a front-line defense. Harden was their best overall pick late for corner depth. 
class	the-sporting-news	jax	c-	GM Trent Baalke was a bit all over the place with value after jumping on Thomas in the first round. Going for offensive tackle and cornerback twice was OK given needs, but there were plenty of reaches, even in taking yet another running back late. Other than Thomas and Little, there's not much here to help the Jaguars catch the Texans in the division. 
class	the-sporting-news	atl	c-	GM Terry Fontenot got plenty of heat from every direction for taking Penix in the top 10 after the team committed big money to Kirk Cousins. Penix's big arm is a good fit in the new passing offense, but the Falcons left a lot of elite, impact talent on the board as part of the opportunity cost. Not surprisingly, they chased that misstep by going defense-heavy for new coach Raheem Morris. McClellan and Washington were real offensive reaches on Day 3.   
class	the-sporting-news	sf	c-	The 49ers had a rare curious draft under John Lynch for many reasons. They added two more wide receivers despite not trading Brandon Aiyuk or Deebo Samuel and making plans to extend Jauan Jennings. They also took some luxury again at running back behind Christian McCaffrey in the speedy Guerendo. Puni and Mustapha are easily the best picks, and they project for depth at first. As a Super Bowl hopeful, there's nothing here that put loaded San Francisco over the top in relation to top NFC rivals. 
class	the-sporting-news	lv	d	The Raiders' draft, from a talent perspective, was fine early. Bowers was worthy of their first-round pick, but it was a bit of a luxury reach with much bigger needs at other positions. Powers-Johnson easily was their best pick, whether he starts at center or right guard. But it cannot be ignored that the Raiders were disinterested in chasing QB or wide receiver at any point in a strong class for both early. Tom Telesco's initial class also pales badly to everyone else in the division.
